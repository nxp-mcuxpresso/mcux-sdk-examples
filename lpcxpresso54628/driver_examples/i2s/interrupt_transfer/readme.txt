Overview
========

The I2S example project uses one I2S interface to continuously playback the sine wave to output.

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54628 boards
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack
- source of sound (line output to 3.5 mm stereo jack)


Board settings
==============
No special settings are required on LPCXpresso54628 board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect headphones to Audio HP / Line-Out connector.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
Headphones will play a sine wave sound.
