Overview
========
The freertos_i2c example shows an application using RTOS tasks with I2C driver:

The example may support 2 different connections (it depends on the specific board): 
On board connection and board to board connection.

With one board connection, 2 I2C instances of the same board are used. One i2c instance used as I2C master and another I2C instance used as I2C slave .
    Default settings in freertos_i2c.c (in folder boards\<board>\rtos_examples\freertos_i2c) is applied.
    Two tasks are created. One task is associated with an I2C master operation and another task deals with I2C slave operation.
    1. I2C master task sends data to I2C slave task.
    2. I2C master task reads data sent back from I2C slave task.

    The transmit data and the receive data of both I2C master task and I2C slave task are printed out on terminal.

With board to board connection, one I2C instance on one board is used as I2C master and the I2C instance on other board is used as I2C slave. Tasks are created to run on each board to handle I2C communication.
    File freertos_i2c.c should have following definitions:
    #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_I2C BOARD_TO_BOARD
    For board used as I2C master:
        #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER
    For board used as I2C slave:
        #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE



Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K22F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example supports 2 different connections:
Using 1 FRDM-K22F board:
    The 2 I2C instances on one board are used, one as I2C master , another as I2C slave.
    The connection should be set as following:
        - J24-12 , J1-13 connected
        - J24-10 , J2-07 connected
Using 2 FRDM-K22F boards:
    The I2C0 module on one board is used as master. The I2C1 module on another board is used as slave.
    The connection should be se as following:
        - J24-12 (master board) connected to J1-13 (slave board).
        - J24-10 (master board) connected to J2-07 (slave board).

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.
    If using 1 FRDM-K22F board:
        Default settings in freertos_i2c.c is applied.
        Build project.
        Download the program to the target board.
    If using 2 FRDM-K22F boards:
        In file freertos_i2c.c in folder: boards\frdmk22f\rtos_examples\freertos_i2c, do following definition:
            #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_I2C BOARD_TO_BOARD
            For master, use following definition
                #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER
                Build project.
                Download the program to one target board (used as master board).
            For slave, use following definition
                #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE
                Build project.
                Download the program to one target board (used as slave board).
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully:
If using 1 FRDM-K22F board, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.



==FreeRTOS I2C example start.==
