## Overview
-----------
The WWDT Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK wdog driver.
In this example,quick test to show user how to feed watch dog.
User need to feed the watch dog in time before it warning or timeout interrupt.
The WINDOW register determines the highest TV value allowed when a watchdog feed is
performed.

## Toolchain Supported
---------------------
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.50.5
- Keil MDK 5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso 11.2.0

## Hardware Requirements
------------------------
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso845MAX board
- Personal Computer

## Board Settings
------------------------
No special settings are required.

## Run the Project
------------------------
Run the example by performing the following steps:

1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP port(J4 on the 
   LPCXpresso845MAX board).

2. Open a serial terminal in PC(for example PUTTY) with the following settings:
   - 9600 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control

3. Compile and download the program to the target board.
   More information about how to compile and program the project can refer to 

   [Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK](../../../../../docs/Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK.pdf).

4. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the project.

5. Monitor the information on the debug console.
