Overview
========
Application demonstrating how to use the a2dp source feature.


Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- evkmimxrt595 board
- Personal Computer
- USB to serial converter
- One of the following modules:
  - AzureWave AW-CM358MA.M2
  - AzureWave AW-CM510MA.M2
  - Embedded Artists 1XK M.2 Module (EAR00385)
  - Embedded Artists 1ZM M.2 Module (EAR00364)


Board settings
==============
Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
If you want to use AzureWave WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM510MA, please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM510MA.
If you want to use AzureWave WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA, please change the macro to WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA.
If you want to use Embedded Artists Type 1XK module (EAR00385), please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_MURATA_1XK_M2.
If you want to use Embedded Artists Type 1ZM module (EAR00364), please change the macro to WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_MURATA_1ZM_M2.


Jumper settings for RT595 (enables external 5V supply):
connect J39 with external power
JP4 1-2
J27 1 - TX of USB to serial converter
J27 2 - RX of USB to serial converter

Debug console UART is configured to use pins of J27, connect the board with PC by USB/UART converter:
- board UART RX (pin 1 on J27) - connect to TX pin on converter
- board UART TX (pin 2 on J27) - connect to RX pin on converter
- board GND (pin 7 on J29) - connect to GND pin on converter

Note:
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly, 
please reset the board by pressing SW3 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Provide 5V voltage for the target board.

4.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

5.  Download the program to the target board.

6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the example in the terminal window.
