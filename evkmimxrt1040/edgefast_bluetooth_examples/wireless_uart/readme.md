Overview
========
The application implements a custom GATT based Wireless UART Profile that emulates UART over BLE.the application can work as central and peripheral at the same time. central and peripheral role can be switched by user button.
To test the service/profile the "IoT Toolbox" application can be used which is available for both Android and iOS.IoT Toolbox can be found on iTunes or Google playstore.

Board settings
==============
Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_bluetooth_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
If you want use the AzureWave WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM510MA, please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM510MA.
If you want use the AzureWave WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA, please change the macro to WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA.
If you want to use Embedded Artists Type 1XK module (EAR00385), please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_MURATA_1XK_M2.

AzureWave Solution Board settings
The hardware should be reworked according to the hardware rework guide for evkmimxrt1040 with Direct Murata M.2 Module in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.


Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly,
please reset the board by pressing SW7 or power off and on the board to run the application.
the SW5 is user button,please do role switch by pressing this button on the board.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

4.  Download the program to the target board.

5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The demo require user interaction. The application will automatically start advertising the wirless uart Service afte reset, the The application can accepte at most 8 connection when work as peripheral.
The application will start scan and connect to the wirless uart Service automatically,after short prees the user button, the The application can connect at most 8 connection when work as cnentral.

after reset, the Serial port terminal log is:

BLE Wireless Uart demo start...
Bluetooth initialized
Advertising successfully started

then we can use "IoT Toolbox" or another wireless_uart example(use B to refer to) to test the current device. 
peripheral role test:
please open "IoT Toolbox", check the "Wireless UART" option, one device named "NXP_WU" will be found, click the "NXP_WU", the software will connect to the NXP_WU, please accept the pair request, or else there maybe pair fail. take android as example, please check the " message notification bar" to find the Pair request. 
after pair, data could be sent/receive in the toolbox.

central role test:
let B work as default state after reset. 
short press the user button, the example will work as central can automatically connect to any discovered wireless uart example.each time short press, the example will scan and connect to wirelss uart service if new device is found.

the device address, AD event type data len, and RSSI are variable, it depend on all the bluetooth device in test environment.


send data 12345 in B device's Serial port terminal, then current device will print the following log. 
Data received (length 5): 12345  

send data 123 in current device's Serial port terminal, then B device will print the following log. 
Data received (length 5): 123

long press the user button, the example will work as peripheral again.
