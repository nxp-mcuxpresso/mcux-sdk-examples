Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- evkmimxrt1040 board
- Personal Computer
- One of the following modules:
  - AzureWave AW-CM358MA.M2
  - AzureWave AW-CM510MA.M2
  - Embedded Artists 1XK M.2 Module (EAR00385)
  - Embedded Artists 1ZM M.2 Module (EAR00364)


Board settings
==============
Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_bluetooth_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
If you want use the AzureWave WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM510MA, please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM510MA.
If you want use the AzureWave WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA, please change the macro to WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA.
If you want to use Embedded Artists Type 1XK module (EAR00385), please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_MURATA_1XK_M2.
If you want to use Embedded Artists Type 1ZM module (EAR00364), please change the macro to WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_MURATA_1ZM_M2.


Jumper settings for RT1040 (enables external 5V supply):
connect J45 with external power
SW6 2-3
J40 1-2

AzureWave Solution Board settings
The hardware should be reworked according to the hardware rework guide for evkmimxrt1040 with Direct Murata M.2 Module in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.


Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly,
please reset the board by pressing SW7 or power off and on the board to run the application.
the SW5 is user button,please do role switch by pressing this button on the board.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

4.  Download the program to the target board.

5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The demo does not require user interaction. The application will automatically start advertising the HTTP Proxy Service and it will accept the first connection request it receives. The application is then ready to process HTTP requests from the peer. The application simulates processing of the HTTP request. It will always return HTTP Status Code 500 and preset values for HTTP Headers and HTTP Body. Example output:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Processing request...
Request processed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
