Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_sem example, what to expect when running it and a brief
introduction to the API. The freertos_sem example code shows how semaphores works. Two different
tasks are synchronized in bilateral rendezvous model.

The example uses four tasks. One producer_task and three consumer_tasks. The producer_task starts by
creating of two semaphores (xSemaphore_producer and xSemaphore_consumer). These semaphores control
access to virtual item. The synchronization is based on bilateral rendezvous pattern. Both of
consumer and producer must be prepared to enable transaction.




SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will show debug console output.
