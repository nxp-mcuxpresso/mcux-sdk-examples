Overview
========

The example shows the way to use ENET QOS driver to  
 receive and transmit frames supported multi-ring platforms.
 this example is only supported in multi-ring platform.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET MAC.
2. How to use ENET MAC to transmit frames in avb supported 
multiple-ring platforms.

The example transmits 20 number frames. For simple demo, we create frames with some special definition.
1. Build transmission frames with broadcast mac address.
2. Build frames with unicast mac address
3. Send broadcast frames to ring 0 and unitcase frames to ring 1, then receive them back in associated rings.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- Loopback network cable RJ45 standard
- MCIMX93-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert loopback network cable to Ethernet RJ45 port(J501).
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Make loopback cable:
    568B standard 	Unknowed standard
J1	orange+white    green+white
J2	orange          green
J3	green+white     orange+white
J4	blue            brown+white
J5	blue+white      brown
J6	green           orange
J7	brown+white     blue
J8	brown           blue+white

Connect J1 => J3, J2 => J6, J4 => J7, J5 => J8. 10/100M transfer only requires J1, J2, J3, J6, and 1G transfer requires all 8 pins.
Check your net cable color order and refer to 568B standard or the other standard. If your cable's color order is not showed in the list,
please connect J1~J8 based on your situation.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

 ENET multi-ring txrx example start.

30 frames will be sent in 3 queues, and frames will be received in  queues.
The frame transmitted from the ring 0, 1, 2 is 10, 10, 10!
30 frames transmitted succeed!
The frames successfully received from the ring 0, 1, 2 is 10, 10, 10!
