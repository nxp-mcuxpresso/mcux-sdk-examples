Overview
========
The spi_dma_b2b_transfer example shows how to use SPI CMSIS driver in dma way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as SPI master and another board used as SPI slave.
The file 'spi_dma_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the SPI slave code.

1. SPI master send/received data to/from SPI slave in dma . 

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- Two FRDM-MCXC242 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI board to board:
Transfers data through SPI interface. SPI0 pins of the master board are
connected to the SPI1 pins of the slave board.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER BOARD           CONNECTS TO         SLAVE BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MOSI       J2 pin 8           MOSI      J2 pin 18
MISO       J2 pin 10          MISO      J2 pin 20
SCK        J2 pin 12          SCK       J1 pin 11
PCS0       J2 pin 6           PCS0      J1 pin 9
GND        J2 pin 14          GND       J2 pin 14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
