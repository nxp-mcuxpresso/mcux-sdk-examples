Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's output compare feature.
It sets up one TPM channel to toggle the output when a match occurs with the channel value. The user
should probe the TPM output with a oscilloscope to see the signal toggling.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-MCXC242 board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
 This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see information from the terminal as below.
