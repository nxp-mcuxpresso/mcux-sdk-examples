Overview
========
The i2c_functional_interrupt example shows how to use I2C functional driver to build a interrupt based application:

In this example , one i2c instance used as I2C master and another i2c instance used as I2C slave .
1. I2C master send data to I2C slave in interrupt . (I2C Slave using interrupt to receive the data)
2. I2C master read data from I2C slave in interrupt . (I2C Slave using interrupt to send the data)
3. The example assumes that the connection is OK between master and slave, so there's NO error handling code.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-MCXC242 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The i2c_polling example is configured 2 instances I2C , one as I2C master , another as I2C slave.
The connection should be set as following:
- J4-12 , J2-20 connected
- J4-10 , J2-18 connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

I2C example -- MasterFuntionalInterrupt_SlaveInterrupt.
Master will send data :
0x 0  0x 1  0x 2  0x 3  0x 4  0x 5  0x 6  0x 7
0x 8  0x 9  0x a  0x b  0x c  0x d  0x e  0x f
0x10  0x11  0x12  0x13  0x14  0x15  0x16  0x17
0x18  0x19  0x1a  0x1b  0x1c  0x1d  0x1e  0x1f

Slave received data :
0x 0  0x 1  0x 2  0x 3  0x 4  0x 5  0x 6  0x 7
0x 8  0x 9  0x a  0x b  0x c  0x d  0x e  0x f
0x10  0x11  0x12  0x13  0x14  0x15  0x16  0x17
0x18  0x19  0x1a  0x1b  0x1c  0x1d  0x1e  0x1f

This time , slave will send data: :
0xff  0xfe  0xfd  0xfc  0xfb  0xfa  0xf9  0xf8
0xf7  0xf6  0xf5  0xf4  0xf3  0xf2  0xf1  0xf0
0xef  0xee  0xed  0xec  0xeb  0xea  0xe9  0xe8
0xe7  0xe6  0xe5  0xe4  0xe3  0xe2  0xe1  0xe0

Master received data :
0xff  0xfe  0xfd  0xfc  0xfb  0xfa  0xf9  0xf8
0xf7  0xf6  0xf5  0xf4  0xf3  0xf2  0xf1  0xf0
0xef  0xee  0xed  0xec  0xeb  0xea  0xe9  0xe8
0xe7  0xe6  0xe5  0xe4  0xe3  0xe2  0xe1  0xe0
