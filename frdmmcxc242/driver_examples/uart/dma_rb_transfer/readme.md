Overview
========
The uart_dma ring buffer example shows how to use uart driver with DMA:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board. And data from PC will be firstly 
stored to a ring buffer using DMA methord, and than application will read the ring buffer 
in a certain time, such as 10ms. While data has already be stored in the ring buffer,
routine will send them back.

And the ring buffer is achieved based on the DMA's source address modulo feature, the base address
should be aligned to a 0-modulo-boundary.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- USB to TTL converter
- FRDM-MCXC242 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect the USB to TTL converter to FRDM-MCXC242 board.
FRDM-MCXC242 UART pins:
- TX of USB2COM to J1-5
- RX of USB2COM to J1-7
- GND of USB2COM to J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Connect the USB to TTL converter to PC host.
3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for the USB to TTL converter with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
