Overview
========
The flexio_i2c_read_accel_value example shows how to use FLEXIO I2C  Master driver to communicate with an i2c device:

 1. How to use the flexio i2c master driver to read a i2c device who_am_I register.
 2. How to use the flexio i2c master driver to write/read the device registers.

In this example, the values of three-axis accelerometer print to the serial terminal on PC through
the virtual serial port on board.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-MCXC242 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The flexio_i2c_read_accel_value example is requires connecting the FLEXIO pins with the I2C pins of accelerometer
But this example no need special setting because of default FlexIO pins using is match with I2C pins of accelerometor
on board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

FlexIO I2C example read accelerometer value
Found an FXOS8700 on board, the device address is 0x1D .
The accel values:
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -21 , y =    12 , z =  2007
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -20 , y =    20 , z =  2008
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -19 , y =     4 , z =  2008
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -20 , y =    29 , z =  2022
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -22 , y =    11 , z =  2008
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -18 , y =    33 , z =  2013
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -28 , y =    21 , z =  2005
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -16 , y =    30 , z =  2022
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -29 , y =    13 , z =  2010
status_reg = 0xff , x =   -14 , y =     6 , z =  2024
