Overview
========
The spi_dma_board2board_master example shows how to use spi driver as master to do board to board transfer with DMA:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on othereboard as slave. Master sends a piece of
data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- Two FRDM-MCXC242 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI board to board:
Transfers data through SPI interface. SPI0 pins of the master board are
connected to the SPI1 pins of the slave board.

MASTER BOARD           CONNECTS TO         SLAVE BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MOSI       J2 pin 8           MOSI      J2 pin 18
MISO       J2 pin 10          MISO      J2 pin 20
SCK        J2 pin 12          SCK       J1 pin 11
PCS0       J2 pin 6           PCS0      J1 pin 9
GND        J2 pin 14          GND       J2 pin 14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Master Start...
Succeed!
