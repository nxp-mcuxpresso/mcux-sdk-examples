Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage method please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The cmsis_spi_dma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use spi driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with DMA:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.5.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- Two LPCXpresso54S018 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect SPI master on board to SPI slave on other board

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
This demo is an external flash plain load demo, ROM will copy image in external flash to SRAMX to run:
1. Build the demo to generate a bin file.
   Note: If need to generate bin file using MCUXpresso IDE, below steps need to be followed:
         Set in example Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build steps->Post-build steps->Edit
         enbable arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "&{BuildArtifactFileName}" "&{BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" 
         
         This plainload example linked the vector table to 0x00000000, but program to external flash 0x10000000.

2. Program the bin file to external on board flash via SEGGER J-FLASH Lite(V6.22 or higher):

   a. Open SEGGER J-FLASH Lite, select device LPC54S018.

   b. Click the 'Erase Chip' to erase the extrenal flash.(if can not success, press SW4 button and reset the board, and try to erase again)

   c. Select the bin data file, set the '.bin/Erase Start' address to 0x10000000, then click 'Program Device'
Note: Please use above way to program the binary file built by armgcc tool chain to external flash. 
      For IAR, KEIL, MCUXpresso IDE, you can use the IDE tool to program the external flash.  
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

SPI CMSIS driver board to board dma example.
This example use one board as master and another as slave.
Master and slave uses DMA way. Slave should start first. 
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is: 
SPI_master -- SPI_slave   
   CLK      --    CLK  
   PCS      --    PCS 
   MOSI     --    MOSI 
   MISO     --    MISO 
   GND      --    GND 

 Master transmit:

  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F
 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F
 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F
 
SPI transfer all data matched! 

 Master received:

  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F
 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F
 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F
