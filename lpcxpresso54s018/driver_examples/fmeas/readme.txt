Overview
========
This example shows how to use SDK drivers to use the Frequency Measure feature of SYSCON module.
It shows how to measure a target frequency using a (faster) reference frequency. The example uses the internal main clock as the reference frequency to measure the frequencies of the RTC, watchdog oscillator, and internal RC oscillator.

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCLPCXpresso54S018 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
This demo is an external flash plain load demo, ROM will copy image in external flash to SRAMX to run:
1. Build the demo to generate a bin file.
   Note: If need to generate bin file using MCUXpresso IDE, below steps need to be followed:
         Set in example Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build steps->Post-build steps->Edit
         enbable arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "&{BuildArtifactFileName}" "&{BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" 
         
         This plainload example linked the vector table to 0x00000000, but program to external flash 0x10000000.

2. Program the bin file to external on board flash via SEGGER J-FLASH Lite(V6.22 or higher):

   a. Open SEGGER J-FLASH Lite, select device LPC54S018.

   b. Click the 'Erase Chip' to erase the extrenal flash.(if can not success, press SW4 button and reset the board, and try to erase again)

   c. Select the bin data file, set the '.bin/Erase Start' address to 0x10000000, then click 'Program Device'
Note: Please use above way to program the binary file built by armgcc tool chain to external flash. 
      For IAR, KEIL, MCUXpresso IDE, you can use the IDE tool to program the external flash.  
The log below shows example output of the frequency measure demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Capture source: Watchdog oscillator (main clock reference), reference frequency = 180000000 Hz
Computed frequency value = 582275 Hz
Expected frequency value = 500000 Hz

Capture source: RTC32K oscillator (main clock reference), reference frequency = 180000000 Hz
Computed frequency value = 21972 Hz
Expected frequency value = 32768 Hz

Capture source: FRO oscillator (main clock reference), reference frequency = 180000000 Hz
Computed frequency value = 11997070 Hz
Expected frequency value = 12000000 Hz
