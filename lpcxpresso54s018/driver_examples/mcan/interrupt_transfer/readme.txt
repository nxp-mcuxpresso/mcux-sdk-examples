Overview
========
The mcan_interrupt example shows how to use MCAN driver in none-blocking interrupt way:

In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to
Endpoint B(board B) when users press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receives the message, prints
the message content to terminal and echoes back the message. Endpoint A will increase the received
message and wait for the next transmission the users initiate.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.5.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Two Micro USB cables
- Two LPCXpresso54S018 boards
- CAN Transceiver
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Since LPCXpresso54S018 has no CAN transceiver on board, extra circuits and CAN transceivers are needed.
The connection should be set as follows:
Between board and Transceiver:
- J10-2, transceiver RXD connected
- J10-4, transceiver TXD connected
Between CAN transceivers:
- CANH, CANL, GND should be connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
This demo is an external flash plain load demo, ROM will copy image in external flash to SRAMX to run:
1. Build the demo to generate a bin file.
   Note: If need to generate bin file using MCUXpresso IDE, below steps need to be followed:
         Set in example Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build steps->Post-build steps->Edit
         enbable arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "&{BuildArtifactFileName}" "&{BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" 
         
         This plainload example linked the vector table to 0x00000000, but program to external flash 0x10000000.

2. Program the bin file to external on board flash via SEGGER J-FLASH Lite(V6.22 or higher):

   a. Open SEGGER J-FLASH Lite, select device LPC54S018.

   b. Click the 'Erase Chip' to erase the extrenal flash.(if can not success, press SW4 button and reset the board, and try to erase again)

   c. Select the bin data file, set the '.bin/Erase Start' address to 0x10000000, then click 'Program Device'
Note: Please use above way to program the binary file built by armgcc tool chain to external flash. 
      For IAR, KEIL, MCUXpresso IDE, you can use the IDE tool to program the external flash.  
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between node A and node B.
