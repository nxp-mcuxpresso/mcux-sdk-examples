Aruba_Flashless_MCM USB Mass Storage RAM Example
=====================================

Example description
-------------------
The example shows how to use USBD ROM stack to create a RAM disk.
When the USB on J3 is connected to a PC, the host would recognize the USB connection as 
a mass storage device. Note that the storage happens on the RAM and is not a persistent storage.


Special connection requirements
-------------------------------
For downloading code and debugging connect an USB cable to micro
connector (J8) and host.
Connect another USB cable between micro connector (J3) on board
and to a host.
