Overview
========
This demo behaves exactly the same with SDK_PATH/boards/frdmk32l2b/demo_apps/bubble, but it focuses on how to use peripheral.c/.h files generated by MCUXpresso Config Tools.

The following files are generated by MCUXpresso Config Tools:
- bubble_peripheral.mex: This mex file contains pin/clock/peripheral settings of this example. User can modify the settings in config tool and generate new source file for pin/clock/peripheral.
- peripheral.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso peripherals tool which could be imported back to the tool.
- clock_config.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso clocks tool which could be imported back to the tool.
- pin_mux.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso pins tool which could be imported back to the tool.

The following files are manually created:
- hardware_init.c: This file will call the initialization functions which are generated by MCUXpresso Config Tools.
- app.h: This file contains case specific macro definitions.
- board.c/.h: These files contain board specific functions or macro definitions.

For more details about the demo itself, please refer to the readme under SDK_PATH/boards/frdmk32l2b/demo_apps/bubble.
