Overview
========
The Hello World SWO demo prints the "SWO: Hello World" string to the SWO viewer. The purpose of this demo is to
show how to use the swo, and to provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- Personal Computer
- Jlink

Board settings
==============
1. Remove jumper of J32, J33
2. SWO pin connection: connect SW7 pin2 to J21 pin13
3. Disconnect JTAG_TDO from J21 pin13: check PCB layout and cut the JTAG_TDO PCB trace.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. This is used only to power the board.
2.  Connect Jlink to J21 as debugger and SWO probe.
3.  Download the program to the target board. This step needs to change the project settings according to the IDE used, please refer to AN13234.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world swo demo in the JlinkerSWOView window and the demo will print output periodically or when SW8 is pressed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SWO: timer_trigger
SWO: timer_trigger
SWO: timer_trigger
SWO: hello_world
SWO: timer_trigger
SWO: timer_trigger
...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:
   This demo targets to run SWO trace function in IDE debug mode and none-debug mode.
   In none-debug mode, may use below command(swoattach mode) with Jlink:
   c:/Program Files/SEGGER/JLink/JLinkSWOViewerCL.exe -device MIMXRT1052xxx6B -itmport 0 -swoattach 1 -swofreq 4000000

Note:
To download binary into hyper flash and boot from hyperflash directly, following steps are needed:
1. Select the target flexspi_nor_debug or flexspi_nor_release.
2. Compile the project, and get the binaray file "hello_world_swo.bin"
3. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 off 3 off 4 on, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J28
4. Drop the binaray into disk "EVK-MIMXRT"
5. Wait for the disk disappear and appear again which will take around ~10s, then power off the board
6. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 on 3 on 4 off, then power on the board
7. After power on the baord, program has already started to run, reset SW4 is recommended. 
 
Note:
To debug in hyper flash in MDK, following steps are needed:
1. Select the target flexspi_nor_debug or flexspi_nor_release.
2. Compile the project.
3. Press F8 or click the download button, to program the application into hyper flash.
4. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 on 3 on 4 off, then power on the board
5. Push SW4 to reset.
6. Start to debug.
