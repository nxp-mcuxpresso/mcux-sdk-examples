Overview
========
The FreeRTOS hello flash operation project is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK UART driver in
combination with FreeRTOS. The purpose of this demo is to show how to use the debug console and to
provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

The example application creates two tasks called flash_operation_task and hello_task . First task operate flash and suspend itself, second task print "Hello world." message periodically via debug console utility.




SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will print "flash opeartion" and "Hello world" message on terminal.

Flash operation done, suspend this task now.
Hello world.
Hello world.
......
Hello world.

Note: RT series maybe mounts different flash type, so it maybe has different flash vendor ID, such as ISSI(0x9d),Winbond(0xEF),Macronix(0xC2).
