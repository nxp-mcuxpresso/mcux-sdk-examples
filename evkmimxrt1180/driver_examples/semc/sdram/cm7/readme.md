Overview
========

The sdramc example shows how to use SEMC controller driver to initialize the external SDRAM chip.



SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
1.  Remove R203, R205-R227 resisters.
2.  Populate R151-R165, R168-R188 with 0ohm resisters.
3.  Remove resistors R2114, R2115, R2118, R2119, R2122, R2123, R2126, R2127, R2130, R2131, R332, R333, to 
    disconnect HyperRAM interface.
4.  Populate these resistors with 0ohm resistor, such as R1329, R2594, R2595, R189-R196, R198, R200-R202, R204.
5.  Remove these resistors, such as R2596, R2597, R228-R235, R238, R240, R242, R244, R246, R248, R250, R252.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
