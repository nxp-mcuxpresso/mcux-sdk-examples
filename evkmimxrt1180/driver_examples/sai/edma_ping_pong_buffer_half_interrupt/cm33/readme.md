Overview
========
The sai_edma_ping_pong_buffer_half_interrupt example shows how to use sai driver with EDMA half interrupt feature to implement ping pong buffer case:

In this example, one sai instance playbacks the audio data stored in flash/SRAM using EDMA channel.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- Headphone(OMTP standard)

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack on MIMXRT1180-EVK board (J101).
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear the tone and the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
