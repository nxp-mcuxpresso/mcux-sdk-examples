Overview
========
The fsl_romapi example shows how to use ROM API:

In this example, fsl_romapi driver will call the API and operate the external Nor flash connected to
the FLEXSPI controller. Some simple flash command will be executed, such as FLEXSPI NOR get config, FLEXSPI NOR Flash init,
Erase sector, Program page.
Example will first erase the sector and program a page into the flash, at last check if the data in flash is correct.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

For FLEXSPI NOR targets, the result is:
