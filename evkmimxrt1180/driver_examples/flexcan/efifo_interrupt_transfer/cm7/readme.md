Overview
========
The flexcan_efifo_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use FlexCAN Enhanced Rx FIFO in none-blocking interrupt way:

In this example, when setting ENABLE_LOOPBACK macro, only one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN Message
Buffer to Tx Message Buffer and setup Enhanced Rx FIFO. After that, the example will send 4 CAN FD Messages
from Tx Message Buffer to Enhanced Rx FIFO through internal loopback interconnect. The sent and received message will be print 
out to terminal

2 boards are required to be connected through CAN bus if ENABLE_LOOPBACK is not defined. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to
Endpoint B(board B) when user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receives the message by Enhanced Rx FIFO, and print
the message content to terminal after receive 4 CAN FD messages.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires 2 sets of boards, each of them are mounted with the base board. Using a male to male CAN
cable to connect the CAN3 instance (J35) between the 2 base boards.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect the micro and mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB ports on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When setting ENABLE_LOOPBACK macro and the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information
from the terminal as below.

2 boards are required to be connected through CAN bus if ENABLE_LOOPBACK is not defined.
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between the node A and the node B.

This message displays on the node A terminal:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
