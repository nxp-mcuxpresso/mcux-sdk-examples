Overview
========
The bubble level demo demonstrates basic usage of the on-board accelerometer to implement a bubble level. A bubble
level utilizes two axes to visually show deviation from a level plane (0 degrees) on a given axis.

The following files are generated by MCUXpresso Config Tools:
- bubble_peripheral.mex: This mex file contains pin/clock/peripheral settings of this example. User can modify the settings in config tool and generate new source file for pin/clock/peripheral.
- peripheral.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso peripherals tool which could be imported back to the tool.
- clock_config.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso clocks tool which could be imported back to the tool.
- pin_mux.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso pins tool which could be imported back to the tool.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar
information from the terminal as shown below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the BUBBLE example

You will see the change of LED brightness when change angles of board

x=  6 y = 22
x=  8 y = 26
x= 10 y = 28
x= 10 y = 28
x= 11 y = 29
x= 11 y = 29
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:
- If the user LED flashes constantly and the following message is printed on the console:
    Sensor device initialize failed!

    Please check the sensor chip U115

  please check if the combo sensor (U115) is presented on the board.
