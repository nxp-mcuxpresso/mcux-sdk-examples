Overview
========
The IEE APC demo application demonstrates usage of the IEE and IEE APC driver. The Inline Encryption Engine (IEE) together with IEE APC provides a means to perform inline encryption and decryption of information transferred over memory interfaces. This demo application configures region 0 to perform AES XTS encryption and decryption while region 1 to perform AES-CTR decryption from external QSPI FLASH memory. Then data are written into RAM memory (region 0), after that encryption is disabled and encrypted data read. After the successful read, encryption is enabled and memory read again to see that data matches the original written value. Another encrypted data are programmed into FLASH memory (region 1) and after encryption is enabled data are read and compared with expected data. 

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world demo in the terminal window:
