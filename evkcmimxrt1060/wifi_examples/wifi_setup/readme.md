Overview
========
This demo implements a simple Wi-Fi station setup. The application will automatically scan local wireless networks at startup, then the user will 
be able to connect to one of the available networks and setup a ping task that will test the connection. 

Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
For more information about Wi-Fi module connection see:

RT1060-EVKC Board Rework For M2 Slot Enablement
A) Wi-Fi Rework:
	- Jumper Settings : Connect J109, connect J76 2-3
    - For 2DS M.2 Module: remove R2163
B) Wi-Fi Host Sleep Wakeup GPIO For 1XK/1ZM/2EL:
    - add 0Ohm resistor at position R252
    - 1XK:
        - Connect Fly-Wire between J33.1 and J108.5.
        - J108 is routed on M2.P44 which internally routed on GPIO[2] of Controller 1XK.
    - 1ZM:
        - Connect Fly-Wire between J33.1 and J108.2.
        - J108 is routed on M2.P40 which internally routed on GPIO[13] of Controller 1ZM.
    - 2EL:
        - No fly-wire connection required.
C) Wi-Fi Independent Reset OOB Trigger For 1XK/1ZM/2EL:
	- Connect Fly-Wire between J16.1 and J108.4.
	- J108 is routed on M2.P48 which internally routed on IR GPIO[15] of Controller 1XK/1ZM.
	- For 2EL-M2, No fly-wire connection required.
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Connect the Wi-Fi module.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.


Running the demo
================
1. When the demo starts, basic initialization proceeds - this might take several seconds.
2. After wifi is initialized, the application will try to scan nearby networks.
3. Once the scan is finished, the user will be prompted to enter SSID and password for one of the scanned networks to join.
4. After successfully joining the network, the user will be requested to specify a valid IPv4 address, which will be used for ping test.
