Overview
========
The lpspi_polling_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI driver in polling way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'lpspi_polling_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the LPSPI slave code.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in polling . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Two MIMXRT1060-EVKC board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Remove the resistor R347,R348,R349,R351,R363,R364,R365.
Weld 0Î© resistor to R346,R350,R356,R362.

SPI one board:
Transfer data from one board instance to another board's instance.
SPI0 pins are connected with SPI0 pins of another board

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
