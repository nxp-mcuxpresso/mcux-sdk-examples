Overview
========
The PXP blend project shows how to blend process surface and alpha surface using
PXP. If this example runs correctly, you will see two rectangles moving in the
screen. One rectangle is process surface output, and the other is alpha surface
output, the overlay region color is OR'ed value of process surface and alpha surface.
