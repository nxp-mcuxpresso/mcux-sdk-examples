Overview
========
The flexio_uart_interrupt_ring_buffer example shows how to use flexio uart driver in interrupt way with
RX ring buffer enabled:

In this example, a flexio simulated uart connect to PC through USB-Serial, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Note: The example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1060-EVKC board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J16-2
- TX of USB2COM to J16-1
- GND of USB2COM to J16-7

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect the USB2COM Converter to the host PC 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
