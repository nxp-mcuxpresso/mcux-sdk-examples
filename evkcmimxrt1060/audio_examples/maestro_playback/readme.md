Overview
========
The maestro_playback application demonstrates audio processing on the ARM cortex core
utilizing the Maestro Audio Framework library.

Depending on target platform there are different features of the demo enabled.

    - File decoding and playback
    - Multi-channel playback

The application is controlled by commands from a shell interface using serial console.

```
Type "help" to see the command list. Similar description will be displayed on serial console:

    >> help

    "help": List all the registered commands

    "exit": Exit program

    "version": Display component versions

    "file": Perform audio file decode and playback

      USAGE: file [stop|pause|volume|seek|play|list|info]
        stop              Stops actual playback.
        pause             Pause actual track or resume if already paused.
        volume=<volume>   Set volume. The volume can be set from 0 to 100.
        seek=<seek_time>  Seek currently paused track. Seek time is absolute time in milliseconds.
        play=<filename>   Select audio track to play.
        list              List audio files available on mounted SD card.
        info              Prints playback info.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- JTAG/SWD debugger
- MIMXRT1060-EVKC board
- Personal Computer
- Headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack

Board settings
==============
For Audio board:
1. Insert AUDIO expansion board into J19 to be able to use the CS42448 codec for multichannel
   output.
2. Uninstall J99
3. Define DEMO_CODEC_CS42448 1 in app_definitions.h

For on board codec:
1. Make sure J99 is installed
2. Define DEMO_CODEC_WM8962 1 in app_definitions.h

Prepare the Demo
================
### Macros settings
- EVKCMIMXRT1060 supports two codecs. Default on board WM8962 codec and additional
codec CS42448 on audio board. To support both of the codecs, the example provides options
to switch between them using macros, located in app_definitions.h:
    - DEMO_CODEC_WM8962, set to 1 if wm8962 is used (on board codec)
    - DEMO_CODEC_CS42448, set to 1 if cs42448 is used (audio board codec)
    Please do not set both macros to 1 together, as the demo supports using one codec at a time.

- This development board also supports multi-channel example. The example demonstrates playback
  of raw PCM files from an SD-card with up to 8 channels, 96kHz sample rate and 32 bit width.
    - To enable multi-channel example:
        1. Connect the Audio board to the development board
        2. Define the MULTICHANNEL_EXAMPLE macro in the project settings
        3. Set the DEMO_CODEC_CS42448 macro to 1 in the app_definitions.h file

### Procedure
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the debug USB port (J53) on the board
2. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
Steps for WM8962:
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack on MIMXRT1060-EVKC board (J101).
Steps for CS42448:
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack J6 and line in line into J12 on the audio board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin
   running the demo.

### Notes
- The AAC decoder is only supported in MCUXpresso and ARMGCC.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you should see similar output on the serial
terminal as below:
```

```

# Known issues
1. MP3 decoder has issues with some of the files. One of the channels can be sometimes
   distorted or missing parts of the signal.
2. Playback is missing a fraction of second in the beginning and end of the stream.
