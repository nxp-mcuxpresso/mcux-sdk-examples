Overview
========
Application demonstrating the BLE Peripheral role, except that this application specifically exposes the HTTP Proxy GATT Service.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- evkcmimxrt1060 board
- Personal Computer
- One of the following modules:
  - Embedded Artists 1XK M.2 Module (EAR00385) - direct M2 connection.
  - Embedded Artists 1ZM M.2 Module (EAR00364) - direct M2 connection.
  - Embedded Artists 2EL M.2 Module (Rev-A1) - direct M2 connection.

Board settings
==============
Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_bluetooth_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
If you want to use Embedded Artists 1XK M.2 Module(EAR00385), please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_MURATA_1XK_M2.
If you want to use Embedded Artists 1ZM M.2 Module(EAR00364), please change the macro to WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_MURATA_1ZM_M2.
If you want to use Embedded Artists 1ZM M.2 Module(Rev-A1), please change the macro to WIFI_IW612_BOARD_MURATA_2EL_M2.

Jumper settings for RT1060-EVKC (enables external 5V supply):
remove  J40 5-6
connect J40 1-2
connect J45 with external power(controlled by SW6)

Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly,
please reset the board by pressing SW7 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

4.  Download the program to the target board.

5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The demo does not require user interaction. The application will automatically start advertising the HTTP Proxy Service and it will accept the first connection request it receives. The application is then ready to process HTTP requests from the peer. The application simulates processing of the HTTP request. It will always return HTTP Status Code 500 and preset values for HTTP Headers and HTTP Body. Example output:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Processing request...
Request processed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
