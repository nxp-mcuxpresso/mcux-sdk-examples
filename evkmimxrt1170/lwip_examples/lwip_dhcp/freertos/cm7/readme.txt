Overview
========

The lwip_dhcp demo application demonstrates a DHCP demo on the lwIP TCP/IP stack.
The application acts as a DHCP client and prints the status as it is progressing.
Once the interface is being bound to an IP address obtained from DHCP server, address information is printed.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- MIMXRT1170-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example uses 1G port(J4) as default. If want to test 100M port(J3), please set the macro BOARD_NETWORK_USE_100M_ENET_PORT to 1.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA(or USB to Serial) USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial(or USB to Serial) device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert the Ethernet Cable into the target board's RJ45 port and connect it to a router (or other DHCP server capable device).
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
