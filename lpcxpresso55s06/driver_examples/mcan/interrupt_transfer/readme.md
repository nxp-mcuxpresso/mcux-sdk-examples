Overview
========
The mcan_interrupt example shows how to use MCAN driver in none-blocking interrupt way:

In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to
Endpoint B(board B) when users press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receives the message, prints
the message content to terminal and echoes back the message. Endpoint A will increase the received
message and wait for the next transmission the users initiate.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Two Micro USB cables
- Two LPCXpresso55S16 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Between CAN transceivers:
- CANH, CANL, GND should be connected

Note: 
When using jlink to download program, please short JP9, Remove JP12. And do not use the serial port J1, J3-1 for UART RX, J3-2 for UART TX.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J1) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between node A and node B.

This message displays on the node A terminal:

Please select local node as A or B:
Note: Node B should start first.
