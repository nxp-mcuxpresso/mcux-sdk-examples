Overview
========
The sai_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use sai driver with interrupt:

In this example, one sai instance playbacks the audio data stored in flash/SRAM using interrupt.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT700-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack on the board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
Note: This demo outputs 215HZ sine wave audio signal.
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear the tone and the log would be seen on the MCU-Link terminal like:
