Overview
========
This example shows how to use SDK drivers to use the Pin interrupt & pattern match peripheral.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT700-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.

Running the demo
================
1.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.

PINT Pin interrupt example

PINT Pin Interrupt events are configured

Press corresponding switches to generate events

2. This example configures "Pin Interrupt 0" to be invoked when SW5(cm33_core0) or SW6(cm33_core1) switch is 
   pressed by the user. The interrupt callback prints "PINT Pin Interrupt 0 event detected".
