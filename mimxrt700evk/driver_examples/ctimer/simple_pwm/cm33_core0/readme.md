Overview
========
The CTimer Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK ctimer driver.
In this example, CTimer is used to generate a PWM signal.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT700-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the USB port on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the CTimer simple PWM demo in the terminal window:

CTimer example to generate a PWM signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use Oscilloscope to measure and observe output signal from J20-8 for cm33_core0 or J5-1 for cm33_core1
to see the ctimer pwm signal.
