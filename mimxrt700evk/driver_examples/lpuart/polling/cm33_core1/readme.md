Overview
========
The lpuart_polling Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 instantly.
Note: Please input one character at a time. If you input too many characters each time, the receiver may overflow
because the LPUART uses simple polling way for receiving.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT700-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============


Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the DEBUG PORT on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the MCU-LINK terminal like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
