Overview
========

The dsp_mu_polling demo application demonstrates starting DSP core with DSP image.

In this example:
1. M33 core send message to DSP in polling mode via MU module.
2. DSP send message back to M33 core in polling mode.
3. M33 core receive message sent from DSP in polling mode.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT700-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J54) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
This example shows two cores communicating using MU. Both M33 and DSP core run at the same time!

When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the M33's debug terminal like as below and the RED LED is blinking:
