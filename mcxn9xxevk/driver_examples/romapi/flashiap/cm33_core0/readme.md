Overview
========
The FLASIAP project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK FLASIAP driver. It erases and programs 
a portion of on-chip flash memory. A message a printed on the UART terminal as various operations on 
flash memory are performed.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N9XX-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

```
Flash driver API tree Demo Application.

Initializing flash driver.
Flash init successfull!.

Config flash memory access time.
