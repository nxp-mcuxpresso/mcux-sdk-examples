Overview
========
This is a small demo of the high-performance ThreadX kernel. It includes
examples of eight threads of different priorities, using a message queue,
semaphore, mutex, event flags group, byte pool, and block pool. Please
refer to Chapter 6 of the ThreadX User Guide for a complete description
of this demonstration.

- MCX-N9XX-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
