Overview
========
This example demonstrates usage of eRPC between two boards using SPI transport layer.
One board acts like a server and the second as client. When client starts, it generates two random
matrixes and sends them to server. Server then performs matrix multiplication and sends
result data back to client. Client then prints the result matrix.

Optional HW setup is to use the PC as the eRPC client and the board as the eRPC server. In this case
the LIBUSBSIOSPITransport (Python) is used on the PC side and the SPI slave transport on the board side.
The libusbsio Python module is used for accessing the NXP libusbsio APIs and thus allowing to exercise SPI, I2C bus and GPIO pins 
from Python application (over USBSIO interface of NXP LPCLink2 and MCUlink Pro devices). 
This configuration is supported for selected boards only. Note, that when more than one board with LPCLink2/MCUlink devices
is connected to the PC the Python application is not able to automatically detect which one to use to establish the communication. Thus, please
ensure only one board with running eRPC server application is connected to the PC when starting the Python application on the PC side 
or use the -d command line argument of the Python application to specify the targetted LPCLink2/MCUlink device index.

PC Side Setup (Optional for PC-to-board communication)
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your PC
2. Install serial module by executing following command in command line: "python -m pip install pyserial"
3. Install eRPC module to Python by executing setup.py located in: middleware\multicore\erpc\erpc_python - "python setup.py install"
4. Install libusbsio module to Python by executing following command in command line: "python -m pip install libusbsio"

usage: run_spi.py [-h] [-b BD] [-g CS_PORT] [-p CS_PIN] [-d DEVIDX]

eRPC Matrix Multiply example

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
  -b BD, --bd BD                Baud rate (default value is 500000)
  -g CS_PORT, --csport CS_PORT  Chip select GPIO port number (see the board schematics)
  -p CS_PIN, --cspin CS_PIN     Chip select GPIO pin number (see the board schematics)
  -d DEVIDX, --devidx DEVIDX    LIBUSBSIO device index (default value is 0 - only one board connected to the host PC)

Example:
To run PC side as a client with a board connected as a server:
"run_spi.py --bd 500000 --csport 0 --cspin 15"

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N9XX-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Keep JP25-on (default)
Populate R11, R12, R13, R14
MCU Link firmware version 2.263 and above needs to be used
Use libusbsio Python module version 2.1.11 (https://pypi.org/project/libusbsio/2.1.11)

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCULink USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.

Running the demo
================
When the target device application is running execute Python run_spi.py from boards\mcxn9xxevk\multiprocessor_examples\erpc_common\erpc_matrix_multiply folder:
python run_spi.py --bd 500000 --csport 0 --cspin 4

When the demo runs successfully, the log below shows the output of the Client eRPC Matrix Multiply demo
in the Python Shell window:
