Overview
========
TensorFlow Lite model based implementation of object detector based on
TensorFlow Lite example [2] adjusted to run on MCUs.

A 3-channel color image is set as an input to a quantized Mobilenet
convolutional neural network model [1] that classifies the input image into
one of 1000 output classes.

Firstly a static stopwatch image is set as input regardless camera is connected or not.
Secondly runtime image processing from camera in the case camera and display
is connected. Camera data are displayed on LCD.

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:
To classify an image, place an image in front of camera so that it fits in the
white rectangle in the middle of the display.
Note semihosting implementation causes slower or discontinuous video experience. 
Select UART in 'Project Options' during project import for using external debug console 
via UART (virtual COM port).

  main.cpp - example main function
  image_data.h - image file converted to a C language array of RGB values
    using Python with the OpenCV and Numpy packages:

    img = cv2.resize(img, (128, 128))
    img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    with open('image_data.h', 'w') as fout:
      print('#define STATIC_IMAGE_NAME "stopwatch"', file=fout)
      print('static const uint8_t image_data[] = {', file=fout)
      img.tofile(fout, ', ', '0x%02X')
