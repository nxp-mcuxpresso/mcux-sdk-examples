Overview
========
The utick project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK utick driver. It sets up the utick
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the utick interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the UART terminal.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXA156 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Utick example start...
UTICK delay 1 second...
UTICK delay 1 second...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
