Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage method please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The lpi2c_int_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use CMSIS i2c driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with interrupt:

In this example, one lpi2c instance as master and another lpi2c instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXA156 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        MASTER(LPI2C0)           connect to        SLAVE(LPI2C3)
        LPI2C0 SCL(P0_17,J2-20)     -->          LPI2C3 SCL(P3_27,J5_5)
        LPI2C0 SDA(P0_16,J2-18)     -->          LPI2C3 SDA(P3_28,J5_6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other jumpers keep default configuration.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a Type-C USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port on the target board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.
