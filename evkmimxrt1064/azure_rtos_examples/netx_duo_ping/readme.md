Overview
========
This is a small ping demo of the high-performance NetX Duo TCP/IP stack.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- EVK-MIMXRT1064 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert Cable to Ethernet RJ45 port and connect it to a ethernet switch.
4.  Write the program to the flash of the target board.
5.  Press the reset button on your board to start the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo is running, the serial port will output:

Start the ping example...
MAC address: 00:11:22:33:44:56
DHCP In Progress...
IP address: 192.168.2.10
Mask: 255.255.255.0

It shows that the board gets a new IP address, for example, 192.168.2.10. Then, on a PC,
use the ping command to ping the new IP address of the board, for example:

$ ping 192.168.2.10
Pinging 192.168.2.10 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=5ms TTL=127
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=127
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=3ms TTL=127
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=127

It shows that the example program running on the board can handle ping packages.
