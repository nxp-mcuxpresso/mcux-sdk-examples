Overview
========

The lwip_httpsrv_mbedTLS demo application demonstrates an HTTPServer set up on lwIP TCP/IP and the MbedTLS stack with
FreeRTOS. The user uses an Internet browser to send an https request for connection. The board acts as an HTTP server
and sends a Web page back to the PC.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1064 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA(or USB to Serial) USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial(or USB to Serial) device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert the Ethernet Cable into the target board's RJ45 port and connect it to your PC network adapter.
4.  Configure the host PC IP address to 192.168.0.100.
5.  Open a web browser.
6.  Download the program to the target board.
7.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1.  When the demo runs successfully, the terminal will display the following:
        Initializing PHY...

        ************************************************
         mbedSSL HTTPS Server example
        ************************************************
         IPv4 Address     : 192.168.0.102
         IPv4 Subnet mask : 255.255.255.0
         IPv4 Gateway     : 192.168.0.100
        ************************************************
2.  On the browser address bar, type https://192.168.0.102(IP address of the board).
	The browser should show a web page.
	Username admin and password admin is required to access "Authorization example" section of the web page.


Modifying content of static web pages
To modify content available through the web server you must complete following steps:
  1. Modify, add or delete files in folder "boards\<board_name>\lwip_examples\lwip_httpssrv_mbedTLS_freertos\webpage".
  2. Run the script file "middleware\lwip\src\apps\httpsrv\mkfs\mkfs.pl <directory name>" to generate new "httpsrv_fs_data.c".
     Make sure to execute it from a folder where the file "httpsrv_fs_data.c" is. For example:
        C:\sdk\boards\<board_name>\lwip_examples\lwip_httpssrv_mbedTLS_freertos> C:\sdk\middleware\lwip\src\apps\httpsrv\mkfs\mkfs.pl webpage
		Processing file webpage/auth.html
		Processing file webpage/cgi.html
		Processing file webpage/favicon.ico
		Processing file webpage/help.html
		Processing file webpage/httpsrv.css
		Processing file webpage/index.html
		Processing file webpage/NXP_logo.png
		Processing file webpage/poll.html
		Processing file webpage/request.js
		Processing file webpage/ssi.shtml
		Processing file webpage/welcome.html
		Done.
  3. Make sure the "httpsrv_fs_data.c" file has been overwritten with the newly generated content.
  4. Re-compile the HTTP server application example and download it to your board.
