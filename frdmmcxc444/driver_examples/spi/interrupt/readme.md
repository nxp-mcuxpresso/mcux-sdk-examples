Overview
========
The spi_interrupt example shows how to use spi functional API to do interrupt transfer:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave,
and check if the data slave received is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXC444 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI one board:
  + Transfer data from instance0 to instance 1 of SPI interface, SPI0 pins are connected with
    SPI1 pins of board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE0        CONNECTS TO         INSTANCE1
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MISO       J1 pin 11          MISO      J2 pin 10
MOSI       J1 pin 9           MOSI      J2 pin 8
SCK        J1 pin 15          SCK       J2 pin 12
PCS0       J1 pin 7           PCS0      J2 pin 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port (J13) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPI one board interrupt example started!

SPI transfer finished!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
