Overview
========
The flexio_spi_slave_interrupt_spi_master example shows how to use flexio spi slave driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated slave connect to a spi master.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXC444 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The flexio_spi_slave_interrupt_spi_master example is requires connecting between FlexIO pins with SPI pins
The connection should be set as following:
	FLEXIO       SPI1
PCS0    J4-1         J2-6
SCK     J4-3         J2-12
MISO    J2-10        J2-18
MOSI    J2-8         J2-20

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port (J13) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPI Master interrupt - FLEXIO SPI Slave interrupt example start.

This example use one spi instance as master and one flexio spi slave on one board.

Master and slave are both use interrupt way.

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

SPI_master -- FLEXIO_SPI_slave

   SCK      --    SCK

   PCS0     --    PCS0

   MOSI     --    MOSI

   MISO     --    MISO

This is FLEXIO SPI slave call back.

SPI master <-> FLEXIO SPI slave transfer all data matched!
