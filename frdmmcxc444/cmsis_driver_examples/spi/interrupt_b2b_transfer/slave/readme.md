Overview
========
The spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer example shows how to use SPI CMSIS driver in interrupt way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as SPI master and another board used as SPI slave.
The file 'spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the SPI slave code.
This example uses the transactional API in SPI driver.

1. SPI master send/received data to/from SPI slave in interrupt . 

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- Two FRDM-MCXC444 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI board to board:
Transfers data through SPI interface. SPI0 pins of the master board are
connected to the SPI1 pins of the slave board.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER BOARD           CONNECTS TO         SLAVE BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MISO       J1 pin 11          MISO      J2 pin 10
MOSI       J1 pin 9           MOSI      J2 pin 8
SCK        J1 pin 15          SCK       J2 pin 12
PCS0       J1 pin 7           PCS0      J2 pin 6
GND        J2 pin 14          GND       J2 pin 14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port (J13) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
