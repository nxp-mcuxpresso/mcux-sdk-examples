Overview
========
The maestro_record application demonstrates audio processing on the ARM cortex core
utilizing the Maestro Audio Framework library.

Depending on target platform there are different features of the demo enabled.

    - Loopback from microphone to speaker
    - Recording microphone to a file
    - Wake words + voice commands recognition

The application is controlled by commands from a shell interface using serial console.

Type "help" to see the command list. Similar description will be displayed on serial console:
```
    >> help

    "help": List all the registered commands

    "exit": Exit program

    "version": Display component versions

    "record_mic": Record MIC audio and either:
    - perform voice recognition (VIT)
    - playback on codec
    - store samples to file.

    USAGE: record_mic [audio|file|<file_name>|vit] 20 [<language>]
    The number defines length of recording in seconds.
    Please see the project defined symbols for the languages supported.
    Then specify one of: en/cn/de/es/fr/it/ja/ko/tr as the language parameter.
    For voice recognition say supported WakeWord and in 3s frame supported command.
    Please note that this VIT demo is near-field and uses 1 on-board microphone.
    To store samples to a file, the "file" option can be used to create a file
    with a predefined name, or any file name (without whitespaces) can be specified
    instead of the "file" option.
    This command returns to shell after the recording is finished.

    "opus_encode": Initializes the streamer with the Opus memory-to-memory pipeline and
    encodes a hardcoded buffer.
```

For custom VIT model generation (defining own wake words and voice commands) please

### Notes
1.  VIT and VoiceSeeker libraries are only supported in the MCUXpresso IDE.
2.  If more than one channel is used and VIT is enabled, please enable VoiceSeeker.
    - The VoiceSeeker that combines multiple channels into one must be used, as VIT can
    only work with one channel.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- RD-RW61X-BGA board
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack


Board settings
==============
Connect JP50; Disconnect JP9, JP11

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect headphones to Audio HP connector (J4).
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU Link USB port (J7) on the board
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings :
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
This example transfers data from DMIC to Codec.
To start the capture, use the "record_mic audio" command.
For further instructions use "help" command.

NOTES:
1. Considering the RAM limitation, opus_encode is not enabled on this platform
