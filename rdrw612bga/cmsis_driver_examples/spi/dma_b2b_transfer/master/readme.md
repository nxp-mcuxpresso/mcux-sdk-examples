Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage method please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The cmsis_spi_dma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use spi driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with DMA:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- RD-RW61X-BGA board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect JP30 1-2, JP9, JP19, JP23, JP51. Disconnect JP47 and connect JP47-1 to GND(J8-6).
Extra rework is needed for the slave board besides the above connection, remove R97, R415, R594
and install R409, R49, R13.

Connect SPI master on board to SPI slave on other board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J7) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

SPI CMSIS driver board to board dma example.
This example use one board as master and another as slave.
Master and slave uses DMA way. Slave should start first. 
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is: 
SPI_master -- SPI_slave   
   CLK      --    CLK  
   PCS      --    PCS 
   MOSI     --    MOSI 
   MISO     --    MISO 
   GND      --    GND 

 Master transmit:

  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F
 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F
 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F
 
SPI transfer all data matched! 

 Master received:

  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F
 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F
 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F
