Overview
========
This example demonstrates the SDK Peripheral drivers working with different methods.

This example demonstrates use of smartcard driver API to read GSM sim card ICC-ID (Integrated circuit card identifier,
which should be placed on the card). 
Please be aware, that this example is just simple demonstration of smartcard driver API. It may not work with all types
of GSM sim cards.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- RD-RW61X-BGA board
- Personal Computer
- GSM sim card
- SIM CARD Board

Board settings
==============
Remove JP44,JP50
Load Jumper on JP33(2)-HD5 and SIM card VCC/IO is required 3.3V.
Connect R537

SIM CARD Board CONNECTS RW61X Board
Pin Name                Pin Name           Board Location
SIM_VCC                 VCC_SDIO_HOST      HD10-9
SIM_RST                 GPIO16_SD_D3       HD10-3
SIM_CLK                 GPIO15_SD_CLK      HD10-11
SIM_SW1                 GPIO19_SD_D0       HD10-13
SIM_IO                  GPIO17_SD_CMD      HD10-5
SIM_VCC_CNTL            GPIO18_SD_D2       HD10-1
GND                     GND                HD10-7

Note:
Card insert detection is not supported since there is no card insert detection circuit on this board.
Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set appropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: one
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.

Running the demo
================
