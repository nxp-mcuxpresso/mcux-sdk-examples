Overview
========
This example shows how to use SDK drivers to use the Pin interrupt & pattern match peripheral.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- RD-RW61X-BGA board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Ensure R520 is removed, R518 is installed to make SW4 work.

No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J7) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1. The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.

PINT Pin interrupt example

PINT Pin Interrupt events are configured

Press corresponding switches to generate events

2. This example configures "Pin Interrupt 0" to be invoked when SW4 switch is pressed by the user.
   The interrupt callback prints "PINT Pin Interrupt 0 event detected".
