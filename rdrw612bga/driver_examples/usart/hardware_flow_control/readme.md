Overview
========
The usart_hardware_flow_control example project demonstrates the usage
of the hardware flow control function. This example sends data to itself(loopback),
and hardware flow control is enabled in the example. The CTS(clear-to-send)
pin is for transmiter to check if receiver is ready, if the CTS pin is asserted,
transmiter starts to send data. The RTS(request-to-send) pin is for receiver
to inform the transmiter if receiver is ready to receive data. So, please connect
RTS to CTS pin directly.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- RD-RW61X-BGA board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
USART hardware flow control on one board.
The USART sends data to itself(loopback), and hardware flow control function is 
enabled on this example. So please make sure the correct connection for example.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pin Name    Board Location    connect to     Pin Name    Board Location
USART_TX    HD2   Pin 4       ----------     USART_RX    HD2   pin 3
USART_CTS   HD11  Pin 14      ----------     USART_RTS   HD11  Pin 8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J7) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is USART hardware flow control example on one board.
This example will send data to itself and will use hardware flow control to avoid the overflow.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
      USART_TX    --     USART_RX
      USART_RTS   --     USART_CTS
Data matched! Transfer successfully.
