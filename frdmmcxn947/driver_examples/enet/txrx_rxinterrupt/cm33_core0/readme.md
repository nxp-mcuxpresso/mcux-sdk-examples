Overview
========

The enet_rxtx_rxinterrupt example shows the simplest way to use ENET functional tx/rx API for simple frame receive and transmit.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET.
2. How to use ENET to receive frame in interrupt irq handler and to transmit frame.

The example transmits 20 number broadcast frame, print the number of recieved frames. To avoid
the receive number overflow, the transmit/receive loop with automatically break when 20 number
are received.



SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Personal Computer
- Loopback network cable RJ45 standard

Board settings
==============
Set JP13 2-3 on.
Populate R274 to sync reference clock.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert loopback network cable to Ethernet RJ45 port.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Make loopback network cable:
      568B standard 	 Unknowed standard
J1    orange+white       green+white
J2    orange             green
J3    green+white        orange+white
J4    blue               brown+white
J5    blue+white         brown
J6    green              orange
J7	  brown+white        blue
J8    brown              blue+white

Connect J1 => J3, J2 => J6, J4 => J7, J5 => J8. 10/100M transfer only requires J1, J2, J3, J6, and 1G transfer requires all 8 pins.
Check your net cable color order and refer to 568B standard or the other standard. If your cable's color order is not showed in the list,
please connect J1~J8 based on your situation.
