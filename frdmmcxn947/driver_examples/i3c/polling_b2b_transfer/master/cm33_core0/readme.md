Overview
========
The example shows how to use i3c driver as master to do board to board transfer using polling method.

In this example, one i3c instance as master and another i3c instance on the other board as slave. Master
first sends a piece of data to slave in I2C mode, and receive a piece of data from slave and check if the
data received from slave is correct. Then master will enter dynamic address cycle to assign address to the
connected slave, after success, will use I3C SDR mode to transfer data, then receive data from the connected
I3C slave and check the data consistency.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
I3C one board:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of I3C interface, I3C0 pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    I3C0 pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
P1_16      J5-3              P1_16      J5-3
P1_17      J5-4              P1_17      J5-4
GND        J5-8              GND        J5-8 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J17) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Press reset button to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.
