Overview
========
The OSTIMER project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK OSTIMER driver. It sets the OSTIMER as
the wakeup source from deep-sleep mode. Board will enter power deep sleep mode, and then wakeup by OS timer after about 5 seconds.
After wakeup from deep-sleep mode, OS timer will set match value 
to trigger the interrupt while the timer count tick reach the match value about every 2 seconds.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J17) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Press any key to start example.

Board will enter power deep sleep mode, and then wakeup by OS timer after about 5 seconds.
After Board wakeup, the OS timer will trigger the match interrupt about every 2 seconds.
Board wakeup from deep sleep mode.
