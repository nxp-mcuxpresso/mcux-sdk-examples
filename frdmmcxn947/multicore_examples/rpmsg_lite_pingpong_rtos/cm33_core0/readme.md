Overview
========
The Multicore RPMsg-Lite pingpong RTOS project is a simple demonstration program that uses the
MCUXpresso SDK software and the RPMsg-Lite library and shows how to implement the inter-core
communicaton between cores of the multicore system. The primary core releases the secondary core
from the reset and then the inter-core communication is established. Once the RPMsg is initialized
and endpoints are created the message exchange starts, incrementing a virtual counter that is part
of the message payload. The message pingpong finishes when the counter reaches the value of 100.
Then the RPMsg-Lite is deinitialized and the procedure of the data exchange is repeated again.

Shared memory usage
This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared memory region is
defined and the size can be adjustable in the linker file. The shared memory region start address
and the size have to be defined in linker file for each core equally. The shared memory start
address is then exported from the linker to the application.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The Multicore RPMsg-Lite pingpong RTOS project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board jumper settings and 
configurations in default state when running this demo.


Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J17) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the RPMsg-Lite pingpong RTOS demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RPMsg demo starts

Copy CORE1 image to address: 0x2004e000, size: 15548
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 1
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 3
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 5
.
.
.
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 101

RPMsg demo ends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note:
The "Copy CORE1 image to address..." log message is not displayed on the terminal window when MCUXpresso IDE is used.
In case of MCUXpresso IDE the secondary core image is copied to the target memory during startup automatically.
