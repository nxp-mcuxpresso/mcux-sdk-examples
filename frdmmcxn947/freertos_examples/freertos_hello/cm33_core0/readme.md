Overview
========
The Hello World project is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK UART drivere in
combination with FreeRTOS. The purpose of this demo is to show how to use the debug console and to
provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

The example application creates one task called hello_task. This task print "Hello world." message
via debug console utility and suspend itself.




SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.14.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.9.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J17) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will print "Hello world" message on terminal.

Example output:
Hello world.
