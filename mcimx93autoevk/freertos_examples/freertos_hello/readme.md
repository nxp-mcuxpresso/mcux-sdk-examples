Overview
========
The Hello World project is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK UART driver in
combination with FreeRTOS. The purpose of this demo is to show how to use the debug console and to
provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

The example application creates one task called hello_task. This task print "Hello world." message
via debug console utility and suspend itself.

1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW2 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J26 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
