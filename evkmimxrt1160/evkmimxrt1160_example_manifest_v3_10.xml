Then the application logic is running. The secondary core (Core1) creates client and server tasks two. The client task initializes the RPMsg-Lite erpc transport and once the server task is running it configures the arbitrated client. Then the application logic is running. The client task logic of the Core1 is very simple, it repeatedly calls the increaseNumber() erpc function that is implemented on the Core0 and that increments the counter. The client task logic of the Core0 alternately issues either getNumberFromCore0() function implementation on the Core0 or getNumberFromCore1() function implementation on the Core1 (erpc call). Then, the nestedCallGetNumber() erpc function call is issued that alternately triggers either getNumberFromCore1() function implementation on the Core1 (normal erpc call) or it triggers the getNumberFromCore0() function implementation on the Core0 (nested erpc call, routed through the Core1 erpc server)." toolchain="armgcc mcuxpresso" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="multicore_examples" path="multicore_examples/erpc_two_way_rpc_rpmsg_rtos/cm4">

It shows how to implement lightweight core to core communication using FreeRTOS Message Buffers, which are lockless circular buffers that can pass data packets of varying sizes from a single sender to a single receiver. The primary core releases the secondary core from the reset and then the inter-core communication is established then. Once the Message Buffers are initialized on both cores the message exchange starts, incrementing a virtual counter that is part of the message payload. The message pingpong finishes when the counter reaches the value of 100. The Message Buffer is deinitialized at the end. NXP Multicore Manager (MCMGR) component is used for several purposes in this example: - it releases the secondary core from the reset (starts the secondary code) - it registers and use the application event for init handshaking (the secondary core application signals to the primary core it is ready to communicate) - it registers and use the FreeRtosMessageBuffersEvent for inter-core interrupts triggering and interrupts handling. Shared memory usage: This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared memory region is defined and the size can be adjustable in the linker file. The shared memory region start address and the size have to be defined in linker file for each core equally. The shared memory start address is then exported from the linker to the application to allow placing FreeRTOS Message Buffers at a fixed location that is then known for both cores." toolchain="armgcc mcuxpresso" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="multicore_examples" path="multicore_examples/freertos_message_buffers/cm4">

In this demo, the ADC clock is set as the maximum frequency, users should input analog signals to the ADC channel, press any keys to trigger the ADC conversion. After sampling enough sample points, the ADC will be disabled and the sample data will be print via UART. Users can use some tools such as EXCEL to recover the input signal based on those printed data." toolchain="armgcc mcuxpresso" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="demo_apps" path="demo_apps/lpadc_high_sample_rate/sample_signal/cm4">

Total conversion time = sampling time + compare time In this demo, users can select sample time, and the compare time is fixed to 17.5 ADC clock cycles.

The demo prints the power mode menuthrough the debug console, where the user can set the MCU to a specific power mode. The user can also set the wakeupsource by following the debug console prompts. The purpose of this demo is to show how to switch between different power modes, and how to configure a wakeup source and wakeup the MCU from low power modes. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware. - Debug pins(e.g SWD_DIO) would consume addtional power, had better to disable related pins or disconnect them.

Then the FIFO would be feed inside the ISR. Then the DAC12 interrupt could be restrained. Once the DAC12 FIFO is triggered in while loop, the data in FIFO is read out, then it becomes less than the watermark, so the FIFO would be feed again in DAC12 ISR. With this example, user can define the DAC12 output array to generate the different wave output.

        <example id="evkmimxrt1160_freertos_message_buffers_cm7" name="freertos_message_buffers_cm7" brief="The FreeRTOS Message Buffers multicore project is a simple demonstration program that uses the MCUXpresso SDK software and the Message Buffers component of FreeRTOS. It shows how to implement lightweight core to core communication using FreeRTOS Message Buffers, which are lockless circular buffers that can pass data packets of varying sizes from a single sender to a single receiver. The primary core releases the secondary core from the reset and then the inter-core communication is established then. Once the Message Buffers are initialized on both cores the message exchange starts, incrementing a virtual counter that is part of the message payload. The message pingpong finishes when the counter reaches the value of 100. The Message Buffer is deinitialized at the end. NXP Multicore Manager (MCMGR) component is used for several purposes in this example: - it releases the secondary core from the reset (starts the secondary code) - it registers and use the application event for init handshaking (the secondary core application signals to the primary core it is ready to communicate) - it registers and use the FreeRtosMessageBuffersEvent for inter-core interrupts triggering and interrupts handling. Shared memory usage: This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared memory region is defined and the size can be adjustable in the linker file. The shared memory region start address and the size have to be defined in linker file for each core equally. The shared memory start address is then exported from the linker to the application to allow placing FreeRTOS Message Buffers at a fixed location that is then known for both cores." toolchain="armgcc mcuxpresso" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="multicore_examples" linked_projects="evkmimxrt1160_freertos_message_buffers_cm4" path="multicore_examples/freertos_message_buffers/cm7">

The purpose of this demo is to show how to switch between different power modes, and how to configure a wakeup source and wakeup the MCU from low power modes. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware. - Debug pins(e.g SWD_DIO) would consume addtional power, had better to disable related pins or disconnect them.
