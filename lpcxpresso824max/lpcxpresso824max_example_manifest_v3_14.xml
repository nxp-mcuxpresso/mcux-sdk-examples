When the application runs to each low powermode, the device would cut off the power for specific modules to save energy. The device can be also waken up by prepared wakeup source from external event. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware. - In order to meet typedef power consumption of DateSheet manual, Please configure MCU under the following conditions.     鈥?

These descriptors are cycled from one to the other.Things to note- The descriptors of the ping pong transfer need to be aligned to size 16- The initial transfer will perform the same job as first descriptor of ping pong, so the first linkeage   is to go to g_pingpong_desc[1]- g_pingpong_desc[1] then chains the g_pingpong_desc[0] as the next descriptor- The properties are set up such that g_pingpong_desc[0] (and the initial configuration uses INTA to signal  back to the callback)- g_pingpong_desc[1] uses INTB to signal to the callback- The scheduled callback uses this information to know which data was last writtenA note on Performance The intent of this example is to illustrate how a double-buffer scheme can be implemented using the dma. The performance of this example will be limited to how quickly the echo printer can read-out the data from the ping pong buffer and display it. This means that the example will work well if characters are entered at a rate where the DMA callback to echo the string can keep up with the input stream. Connecting the USARTRX to a continuous fast speed will cause the DMA to fall behind.

When user type in any key from the keyboard, the software trigger API is called to start the conversion. Then it polls the conversion sequence A's flag till the conversion is completed. When the conversion is completed, just print the conversion result to terminal.Project Information1.what are ADC conversion sequences?  A conversion sequence is a single pass through a series of A/D conversions performed on a selected set of  A/D channels. Software can set-up two independent conversion sequences, either of which can be triggered   by software or by a transition on one of the hardware triggers. Each sequence can be triggered by a different   hardware trigger. One of these conversion sequences is referred to as the A sequence and the other as the B  sequence. It is not necessary to employ both sequences. An optional single-step mode allows advancing through  the channels of a sequence one at a time on each successive occurrence of a trigger. The user can select whether  a trigger on the B sequence can interrupt an already-in-progress A sequence. The B sequence, however, can never be  interrupted by an A trigger.  2. How to use software-triggered conversion?   There are two ways that software can trigger a conversion sequence:      1. Start Bit: The first way to software-trigger an sequence is by setting the START bit in         the corresponding SEQn_CTRL register. The response to this is identical to         occurrence of a hardware trigger on that sequence. Specifically, one cycle of         conversions through that conversion sequence will be immediately triggered except         as indicated above. (In this example, we use this way.)      2. Burst Mode: The other way to initiate conversions is to set the BURST bit in the         SEQn_CTRL register. As long as this bit is 1 the designated conversion sequence will         be continuously and repetitively cycled through. Any new software or hardware trigger         on this sequence will be ignored.

Setting   SEQA_CTRL_START to '1' will trigger sequence A.  4.After ADC channels are assigned to each of the sequences, if the user enters any key via terminal, software trigger will start. 5.Read the corresponding DATAVALID field with polling to judge whether the conversion completes and the result is ready.
