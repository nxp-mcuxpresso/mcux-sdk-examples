Overview
========
The SDCARD FatFs FreeRTOS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes
/erases the SD card continuously. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver
with FatFs and freeRTOS in SDK software to access SD card.
Note: The output log of the case is not constant, since difference of card access speed and platform will affect the behavior of card access task.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Insert the card into the card slot

Prepare the Example
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the LPC-Link USB port (P6) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FATFS example to demonstrate how to use FATFS with SD card.

Please insert a card into board.

Card inserted.

Make file system......The time may be long if the card capacity is big.

Create directory......

Create a file in that directory......

Create a directory in that directory......

List the file in that directory......
General file : F_1.DAT.
Directory file : DIR_2.

Write/read file until encounters error......

Write to above created file.
Read from above created file.
Compare the read/write content......
The read/write content is consistent.

Input 'q' to quit read/write.
Input other char to read/write file again.
