Overview
========
The maestro_demo application demonstrates audio processing on the ARM cortex core
utilizing the Maestro Audio Framework library.

Depending on target platform there are different features of the demo enabled.

    - Loopback from microphone to speaker
    - Recording microphone to a file
    - Wake words + voice commands recognition

The application is controlled by commands from a shell interface using serial console.

Type "help" to see the command list. Similar description will be displayed on serial console:

    >> help

    "help": List all the registered commands

    "exit": Exit program

    "version": Display component versions

    "record_mic": Record MIC audio and either:
     - perform voice recognition (VIT)
     - playback on codec
     - store samples to file.

     USAGE: record_mic [audio|file|<file_name>|vit] 20 [en|cn]
     The number defines length of recording in seconds.
     For voice recognition say supported WakeWord and in 3s frame supported command.
     Please note that this VIT demo is near-field and uses 1 on-board microphone.
     NOTES: This command returns to shell after record finished.
             To store samples to a file, the "file" option can be used to create a file
             with a predefined name, or any file name (without whitespaces) can be specified
             instead of the "file" option.

    "opus_encode": Initializes the streamer with the Opus memory-to-memory pipeline and
    encodes a hardcoded buffer.

For custom VIT model generation (defining own wake words and voice commands) please use https://vit.nxp.com/


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack
- source of sound (line output to 3.5 mm stereo jack)


Board settings
==============
Insert the card into the card slot

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect headphones to Audio HP / Line-Out connector.
2.  Connect source of sound to Audio Line-In connector.
3.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (P6) on the board
4.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings :
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Note:
There is limited RAM on this platform, which brings following limitations:
 - VIT is not enabled
Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you should see similar output on the serial terminal as below:
