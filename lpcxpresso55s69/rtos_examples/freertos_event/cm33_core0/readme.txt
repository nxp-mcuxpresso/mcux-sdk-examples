Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_event example. It shows how task waits for an event (defined set
of bits in event group). This event can be set by any other process or interrupt in the system.

The example application creates three tasks. Two write tasks write_task_1 and write_task_2
continuously setting event bit 0 and bit 1.

Read_task is waiting for any event bit and printing actual state on console. Event bits are
automatically cleared after read task is entered.

Three possible states can occurre:
Both bits are set.z
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect a USB2COM between the PC host and the board UART pins
boards           -               USB2COM
J14-Pin26                        Tx
J14-Pin28                        Rx
J14-Pin1                         GND

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J7) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will start printing the state of event bits.

Example output:
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set
