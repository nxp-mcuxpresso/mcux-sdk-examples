Overview
========
The SCTimer 16-bit counter project is a demonstration program of the SDK SCTimer driver operation when using the SCTimer counter
as two 16-bit counters.
The example toggles an output per counter when a match occurs.

To use any 16-bit counter, this project disables the Unify 32-bit Counter by hardware limit, no matter the Low 16-bit one or the
High 16-bit one. Both the Low 16-bit counters or the High 16-bit counters  enable bidirectional mode to extend the 16-bit counting
range. When the counter is in bidirectional mode, the effect of setting and clearing the output depends on whether the counter is
counting up or down.
The 16-bit low counter is scheduled for a match event every 0.1 seconds, and the 16-bit High counter is scheduled for a match event
every 0.2 seconds. When a 16-bit counter event occurs, the output is toggled and the counter is reset.

# Prepare the Demo
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (P6) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCTimer example to use it in 16-bit mode
The example shows both 16-bit counters running and toggling an output periodically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Probe oscilloscope at P18_11(5HZ) and P18_13(2.5HZ) to see output signal.
