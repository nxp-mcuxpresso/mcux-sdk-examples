Overview
========
The example shows how to use i3c driver as slave to do board to board transfer with a interrupt master.

In this example, one i3c instance as slave and another i3c instance on the other board as master. Master
first sends a piece of data to slave in I2C mode, and receive a piece of data from slave and check if the
data received from slave is correct. Then master will enter dynamic address cycle to assign address to the
connected slave, after success, will use I3C SDR mode to transfer data, then receive data from the connected
I3C slave and check the data consistency.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-QSB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To make the example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER                        connect to        SLAVE
Pin Name    Board Location                      Pin Name    Board Location
SCL         J1005 pin 3                         SCL         J1005 pin 3
SDA         J1005 pin 5                         SDA         J1005 pin 5
GND         J1005 pin 7                         GND         J1005 pin 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and JLink Plus to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Tips: The I3C use the same PHY pin as LPI2C, Acore already use the i2c resource. Please test the function in "LOW POWER MODE" only.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.
