Overview
========
The flexcan_efifo_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use FlexCAN Enhanced Rx FIFO in none-blocking interrupt way:

In this example, when setting ENABLE_LOOPBACK macro, only one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN Message
Buffer to Tx Message Buffer and setup Enhanced Rx FIFO. After that, the example will send 4 CAN FD Messages
from Tx Message Buffer to Enhanced Rx FIFO through internal loopback interconnect. The sent and received message will be print 
out to terminal

2 boards are required to be connected through CAN bus if ENABLE_LOOPBACK is not defined. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to
Endpoint B(board B) when user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receives the message by Enhanced Rx FIFO, and print
the message content to terminal after receive 4 CAN FD messages.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- two MCIMX93-QSB board
- JLink Plus
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Switch S1501 to "ON" on two boards.
The example requires connecting between CAN pins of two boards.
The connection should be set as follows:

Between two boards:
- J1501-2(CANH) node A, J1501-2(CANH) node B
- J1501-3(CANL) node A, J1501-3(CANL) node B
- J1406-7(GND) node A, J1406-7(GND) node B

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and JLink Plus to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1708 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This message displays on the node A terminal:
