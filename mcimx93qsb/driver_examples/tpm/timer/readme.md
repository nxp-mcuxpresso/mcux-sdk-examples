Overview
========
The TPM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver to use TPM as a timer.
It sets up the TPM hardware block to trigger an interrupt every 1 millisecond.
When the TPM interrupt is triggered 1000 times, a message is printed on the UART terminal.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB Type-C cable
- MCIMX93-QSB board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a USB Type-C cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TPM example to simulate a timer

You will see a "-" or "|" in terminal every 1 second:
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
