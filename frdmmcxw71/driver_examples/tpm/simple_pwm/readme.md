Overview
========
The TPM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver. It sets up the TPM
hardware block to output a center-aligned PWM signal(24kHZ). The PWM duty cycle is manually updated and is initially 10%.
On boards that have an LED connected to the TPM pins, the user will see a change in LED
brightness if user enter different values.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXW71 Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the FRDM board J10.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.

TPM example to output center-aligned PWM signal

If an LED is connected to the TPM pin, you will see a change in LED brightness if you enter different values
If no LED is connected to the TPM pin, then probe the signal using an oscilloscope
Please enter a value to update the Duty cycle:
Note: The range of value is 0 to 9.
For example: If enter '5', the duty cycle will be set to 50 percent.
