Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's output compare feature.
It sets up one TPM channel to toggle the output when a match occurs with the channel value. The user
should probe the TPM output with a oscilloscope to see the signal toggling.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXW71 Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the FRDM board J10.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.
