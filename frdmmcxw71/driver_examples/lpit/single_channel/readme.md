Overview
========
The LPIT single channel project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT driver. It sets up the LPIT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the LPIT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the serial terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXW71 Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
And LED D11 is blinking
