Overview
========
The LED Blinky demo application provides a sanity check for the new SDK build environments and board bring up. The LED Blinky demo 
uses the systick interrupt to realize the function of timing delay. The example takes turns to shine the LED. The purpose of this 
demo is to provide a simple project for debugging and further development.
The code of this demo has been prepared and updated for use with the MCUXpresso Configuration Tools (Pins/Clocks/Peripherals).
