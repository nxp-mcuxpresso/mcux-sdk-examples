Overview
========
The maestro_record application demonstrates audio processing on the ARM cortex core
utilizing the Maestro Audio Framework library.

Depending on target platform there are different features of the demo enabled.

    - Loopback from microphone to speaker
    - Recording microphone to a file
    - Wake words + voice commands recognition

The application is controlled by commands from a shell interface using serial console.

Type "help" to see the command list. Similar description will be displayed on serial console:
```
    >> help

    "help": List all the registered commands

    "exit": Exit program

    "version": Display component versions

    "record_mic": Record MIC audio and either:
    - perform voice recognition (VIT)
    - playback on codec
    - store samples to file.

    USAGE: record_mic [audio|file|<file_name>|vit] 20 [<language>]
    The number defines length of recording in seconds.
    Please see the project defined symbols for the languages supported.
    Then specify one of: en/cn/de/es/fr/it/ja/ko/tr as the language parameter.
    For voice recognition say supported WakeWord and in 3s frame supported command.
    Please note that this VIT demo is near-field and uses 1 on-board microphone.
    To store samples to a file, the "file" option can be used to create a file
    with a predefined name, or any file name (without whitespaces) can be specified
    instead of the "file" option.
    This command returns to shell after the recording is finished.

    "opus_encode": Initializes the streamer with the Opus memory-to-memory pipeline and
    encodes a hardcoded buffer.
```

For custom VIT model generation (defining own wake words and voice commands) please

### Notes
1.  VIT and VoiceSeeker libraries are only supported in the MCUXpresso IDE.
2.  If more than one channel is used and VIT is enabled, please enable VoiceSeeker.
    - The VoiceSeeker that combines multiple channels into one must be used, as VIT can
    only work with one channel.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N5XX-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack
- micro SD card for file output

Board settings
==============
Insert the micro SD card into the card slot
Short JP7 2-3, JP8 2-3, JP10 2-3, JP11 2-3

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect headphones to Audio HP / Line-Out connector.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings :
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

# Note
Some VIT models can't fit into memory. In order to free some space it is necessary to disable SD card handling.
 - remove SD_ENABLED and STREAMER_ENABLE_FILE_SINK symbols from project settings

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you should see similar output on the serial terminal as below:
```
