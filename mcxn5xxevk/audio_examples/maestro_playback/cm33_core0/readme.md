1.  Connect headphones to Audio HP / Line-Out connector.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings :
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you should see similar output on the serial
terminal as below:
