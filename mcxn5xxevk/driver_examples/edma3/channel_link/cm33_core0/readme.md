Overview
========
The EDMA channel link example is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK software.
It excuates channel link transfer using the SDK EDMA drivers.
The purpose of this example is to show how to use the EDMA and to provide a simple example for
debugging and further development, it demostrates how to use the minor loop link and major loop link:
Since each transfer request can be divided into MAJOR_LOOPS_COUNTS * MINOR_LOOPS_BYTES,
such as you want to request EDMA transfer 8 bytes total, 4 bytes each request, then MAJOR_LOOPS_COUNTS = 2, MINOR_LOOPS_BYTES = 4.
The minor loop channel linking occurs at the completion of the minor loop 4 byte transferred.
The major loop channel linking is occurs at the major loop exhausted.
The example demostrate the channel link transfer by the feature of edma4:



SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N5XX-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
