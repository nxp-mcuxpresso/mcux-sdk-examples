Overview
========
The lpadc_light_sensor example shows how to use the LPADC driver to measure the voltage value
in the circuit with a light sensor. In this example, the specific ADC channel has been connected
into the circuit by board design. When running the project, typing any key into the debug console
would trigger the conversion. The execution would check the FIFO valid flag in a loop until the flag
is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. Then read the conversion result value and print
it to the debug console.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCX-N5XX-EVK Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project uses LPADC1 channel 0 to collect the output voltage of the circuit,
which has a light sensor, and the output voltage is proportional to the light illuminance.
When the illuminance increases, the output voltage increases, and the value printed by the
terminal is also larger.

Note that on some MCX-N5XX-EVK boards, the circuit that has a light sensor does not weld up
the resistor SH1 and capacitor C202; before running this example, please check it.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect the micro USB cable between the PC host and the USB ports on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.
