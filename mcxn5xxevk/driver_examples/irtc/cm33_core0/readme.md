Overview
========

The IRTC project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK IRTC driver.
This example is a low power module that provides time keeping and calendaring functions and additionally provides
protection against tampering, protection against spurious memory/register updates and battery operation.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N5XX-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
