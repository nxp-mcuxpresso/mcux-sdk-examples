Overview
========
The flexspi_nor example shows how to use flexspi driver:

In this example, flexspi will send data and operate the external Nor flash connected with FLEXSPI. Some simple flash command will
be executed, such as Write Enable, Erase sector, Program page.
Example will first erase the sector and program a page into the flash, at last check if the data in flash is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N5XX-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
