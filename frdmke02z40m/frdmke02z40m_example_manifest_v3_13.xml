When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC interrupt would be asserted once the conversion is completed. In ADC ISR, the conversion completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The point is that the adc interrupt configuration is set when configuring the adc's conversion channel. When in software trigger mode, the conversion would be launched by the operation of configuring channel, just like writing aconversion command.
