Overview
========
The example creates a simple washing machine demonstration. It shows
a UI on a LCD panel with touch panel. It also can interact with user.

Define GUIX_PXP_ENABLE to enable Pixel Pipeline engine (PXP).
It can accelerate the image process.

    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055MHD091 by default, to use other panels,
    change
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091
    to
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055IQH091
    or
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    in display_support.h.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
