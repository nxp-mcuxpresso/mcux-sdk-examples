Overview
========
The example demonstrates how to use the UART driver. For i.mx RT,
it's the LPUART driver. For LPC, it's the USART driver.

The example writes the welcome message into the default UART port. Read 4 characters
for the port, then write them back.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The welcome message will be printed out on the console:
