Overview
========
Application demonstrating how to use the SPP feature.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- evkbmimxrt1170 board
- Personal Computer
- Embedded Artists 1XK M.2 Module (EAR00385) - direct M2 connection.
- Embedded Artists 1ZM M.2 Module (EAR00364) - direct M2 connection.
- Embedded Artists 2EL M.2 Module (Rev-A1) - direct M2 connection.

Jumper settings for RT1170-EVKB (enables external 5V supply):
remove  J38 5-6
connect J38 1-2
connect J43 with external power(controlled by SW5)

The hardware should be reworked according to the Hardware Rework Guide for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1XK M.2 Adapter in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.
The hardware should be reworked according to the Hardware Rework Guide for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1ZM M.2 Adapter in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.
The hardware rework for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 2EL M.2 Adapter is same as MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1XK M.2 Adapter.
Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly,
please reset the board by pressing SW4 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Provide 5V voltage for the target board.

4.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

5.  Download the program to the target board.

6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the example in the terminal window.

1.  Procedure to run SPP server
1.1 input "help" to show command list
1.2 input "spp register 3" to register spp server channel 3, wait for spp connection
1.3 After spp connection on channel 3 is created, input "spp send [1|2|3|4]" to send data
1.4 After peer device send "spp set_pn client 3", input "spp get_pn server 3" to test pn command
1.5 After peer device send "spp set_port client 5", input "spp register 5" to register spp server channel 5 and wait for spp connection
1.6 After spp connection on channel 5 is created, input "spp get_port server 5" to test remote port negotiation command after spp connection is created
1.7 input "spp handle" to show current active spp handle
1.8 input "spp switch 0" to select the first spp handle
1.9 input "spp disconnect" to disconnect with peer device

2.  Procedure to run SPP client
2.1 input "bt discover" to discover connctable bluetooth device
2.2 input "bt connect [index]" to create basic bluetooth connection with the discovered device
2.3 input "spp discover" to discover registered spp server channel in peer device
2.4 input "spp connect 3" to create spp connection on channel 3 with peer device
2.5 After spp connection on channel 3 is created, input "spp send [1|2|3|4]" to send data
2.6 After spp connection on channel 3 is created, input "spp send_rls" to test remote line status command
2.7 After spp connection on channel 3 is created, input "spp send_msc" to test modem status command
2.8 After spp connection on channel 3 is created, input "spp set_pn client 3" to test parameter command
2.9 input "spp get_port client 5" to test remote port negotiation command before spp connection on channel 5 is created
2.10 input "spp set_port client 5" to test remote port negotiation command before spp connection on channel 5 is created
2.11 input "spp connect 5" to create spp connection on channel 5 with peer device
2.12 input "spp get_port client 5" to test remote port negotiation command after spp connection on channel 5 is created
