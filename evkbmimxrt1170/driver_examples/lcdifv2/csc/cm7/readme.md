Overview
========
This example demonstrates how to use the LCDIF v2 driver to do the YUV to RGB
conversion. In this example, the frame buffer pixel format is YUV, the byte
order in frame buffer is:

Y U Y V Y U Y V ...

The LCDIV v2 converts the color internally and sends out RGB color to the panel.

When the example runs, the panel shows four color blocks:

+-------------------------------+
|            RED                |
+-------------------------------+
|            GREEN              |
+-------------------------------+
|            BLUE               |
+-------------------------------+
|            WHITE              |
+-------------------------------+

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVKB board
- Personal Computer
- RK055MHD091 panel or RK055AHD091 panel or RK055IQH091 panel or RaspberryPi panel

Board settings
==============
Connect the panel to J48. For RaspberryPi panel, connect the panel to J84,
then connect the panel's 5V pin to J85-1, GND pin to J85-2.
Connect 5V power to J43, set J38 to 1-2

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055MHD091 by default, to use other panels,
    change
    #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055MHD091
    to
    #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055IQH091
    or
    #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    or
    #define USE_MIPI_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RASPI_7INCH
    in lcdifv2_support.h.
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs, the screen shows what described in overview.
