Overview
========
The flexio_lpi2c_interrupt example shows how to use flexio i2c master  driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated i2c master connect to a LPI2C slave

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To make this example work, connections needed to be as follows:

    FLEXIO_I2C        connected to  LPI2C5
SCL     J26-2           -->        J10-20
SDA     J26-4           -->        J10-18

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
You can see the similar message shows following in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

Note:
In ARMCC: When reading from the flash, 64M flash requires 4 bytes of address, which leads to slow code 
execution in the flash and flexio FIFO underflow. The project use a method to reduce the baud rate. 
Other methods include putting fsl_flexio_i2c.c fsl_flexio_i2c_master.c fsl_lpi2c.c code in RAM 
or modifying qspiflash_config in evkbmimxrt1170_flexspi_nor_config.c file to use shorter flash address and smaller flash space.
