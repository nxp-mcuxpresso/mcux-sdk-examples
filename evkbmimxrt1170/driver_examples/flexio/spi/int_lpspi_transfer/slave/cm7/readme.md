Overview
========
The flexio_spi_slave_interrupt_lpspi_master example shows how to use flexio spi slave driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated slave connect to a lpspi master.



SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Remove 0Î© resistor to R200,R406.

To make the example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to      SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J10-10               SIN       J26-6
SIN        J10-8                SOUT      J26-4
SCK        J10-12               SCK       J26-2
PCS0       J10-6                PCS0      J26-8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
You can see the similar message shows following in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LPSPI Master interrupt - FLEXIO SPI Slave interrupt example start.

This example use one lpspi instance as master and one flexio spi slave on one board.

Master and slave are both use interrupt way.

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

LPSPI_master -- FLEXIO_SPI_slave

   CLK      --    CLK

   PCS      --    PCS

   SOUT     --    SIN

   SIN      --    SOUT

This is FLEXIO SPI slave call back.

LPSPI master <-> FLEXIO SPI slave transfer all data matched!

End of Example.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This case use flexio to simulate spi protocol, 

Owing to this simulate process is software and executed in qspi_flash for flexspi_nor target, 

but external flash's speed can not support to the rate of SPI transmit because of effected by performance. 

So the settings for baudrate of transmission do not more than 150k.
