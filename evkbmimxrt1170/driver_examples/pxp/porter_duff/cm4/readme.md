Overview
========
This example shows how to use the PXP Porter Duff compositing. In this example,
A blue rectangle is in the left up corner of the destination surface (also named
PS surface, or s0 in reference mannal). A red rectangle is in the center of the
source surface (also named AS surface, or s1 in reference mannal). Every Porter Duff
mode result is shown 2 seconds, then switch to the other mode.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVKB board
- Personal Computer
- RK055MHD091 panel or RK055AHD091 panel or RK055IQH091 panel

Board settings
==============
Connect the panel to J48
Connect 5V power to J43, set J38 to 1-2

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055MHD091 by default, to use other panels,
    change
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091
    to
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055IQH091
    or
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    in display_support.h.
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
