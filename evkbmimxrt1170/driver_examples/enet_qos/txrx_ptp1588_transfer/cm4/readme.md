Overview
========

The example shows the way to use ENET driver to
 receive and transmit frame in the 1588 feature required cases.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET.
2. How to get the time stamp of the PTP 1588 timer.
3. How to use Get the ENET transmit and receive frame time stamp.

The example transmits 20 number PTP event frame, shows the timestamp of the transmitted frame.
The length, source MAC address and destination MAC address of the received frame will be print.
The time stamp of the received timestamp will be print when the PTP message frame is received(the outside loopback cable can be used to see the right rx time-stamping log since we send the ptp message).

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Loopback network cable RJ45 standard
- MIMXRT1170-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
If Rx frame CRC error occurs, try to populate a suitable C66. The REV C/C1 boards populate 22pF which is high and may result in CRC
errors on some of boards, if this is the case C66 may be removed or replaced by a smaller capacitor.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert loopback network cable to Ethernet RJ45 port(J4).
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Make loopback cable:
    568B standard 	Unknowed standard
J1	orange+white    green+white
J2	orange          green
J3	green+white     orange+white
J4	blue            brown+white
J5	blue+white      brown
J6	green           orange
J7	brown+white     blue
J8	brown           blue+white

Connect J1 => J3, J2 => J6, J4 => J7, J5 => J8. 10/100M transfer only requires J1, J2, J3, J6, and 1G transfer requires all 8 pins.
Check your net cable color order and refer to 568B standard or the other standard. If your cable's color order is not showed in the list,
please connect J1~J8 based on your situation.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
