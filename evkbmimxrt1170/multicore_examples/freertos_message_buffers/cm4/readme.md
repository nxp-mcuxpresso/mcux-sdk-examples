Overview
========
The FreeRTOS Message Buffers multicore project is a simple demonstration program that uses the
MCUXpresso SDK software and the Message Buffers component of FreeRTOS. It shows how to implement 
lightweight core to core communication using FreeRTOS Message Buffers, which are lockless circular buffers 
that can pass data packets of varying sizes from a single sender to a single receiver.
The primary core releases the secondary core from the reset and then the inter-core communication 
is established then. Once the Message Buffers are initialized on both cores the message exchange starts,
incrementing a virtual counter that is part of the message payload. The message pingpong finishes 
when the counter reaches the value of 100. The Message Buffer is deinitialized at the end.
NXP Multicore Manager (MCMGR) component is used for several purposes in this example:
- it releases the secondary core from the reset (starts the secondary code)
- it registers and use the application event for init handshaking (the secondary core application 
  signals to the primary core it is ready to communicate)
- it registers and use the FreeRtosMessageBuffersEvent for inter-core interrupts triggering and
  interrupts handling  

Shared memory usage
This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared memory region is
defined and the size can be adjustable in the linker file. The shared memory region start address
and the size have to be defined in linker file for each core equally. The shared memory start
address is then exported from the linker to the application to allow placing FreeRTOS Message Buffers
at a fixed location that is then known for both cores.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The FreeRTOS Message Buffers multicore project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board jumper settings and 
configurations in default state when running this demo.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.


Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the FreeRTOS Message Buffers multicore demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FreeRTOS Message Buffers demo starts

Copy CORE1 image to address: 0x20200000, size: 15548
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 1
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 3
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 5
.
.
.
Primary core received a msg
Message: Size=4, DATA = 101

FreeRTOS Message Buffers demo ends

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note:
The "Copy CORE1 image to address..." log message is not displayed on the terminal window when MCUXpresso IDE is used.
In case of MCUXpresso IDE the secondary core image is copied to the target memory during startup automatically.

Note:
To download and debug IAR EW project using J-Link (replacing the default CMSIS-DAP debug probe), following steps are needed:
1. Remove J6 and J7 jumpers.
2. Attach the J-Link probe (J-Link Plus / J-Trace) to the board using the J1 connector.
3. Set "J-Link / J-Trace" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Setup panel (replacing CMSIS-DAP option).
4. Unselect the "Use macro file(s)" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Setup panel.
5. Enable "Use command line options" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Extra Options panel 
   (--jlink_script_file=$PROJ_DIR$/../evkbmimxrt1170_connect_cm4_cm7side.jlinkscript command line option is applied).
5. Click on "Download and Debug" button. During the loading process you can be asked by J-Link sw
   to select the proper device name (MIMXRT1176XXXA_M7 is unknown). Click O.K. and choose the MIMXRT1176xxxxA device.
6. It is not possible to attach to the CM4 core when using the J-Link. Also, the multicore debugging does not work with that probe.

Note:
To download and debug Keil MDK project using J-Link (replacing the default CMSIS-DAP debug probe), following steps are needed:
1. Remove J6 and J7 jumpers.
2. Attach the J-Link probe (J-Link Plus / J-Trace) to the board using the J1 connector.
3. Set "J-LINK / J-TRACE Cortex" in CM7 project options -> Debug panel (replacing CMSIS-DAP Debugger option).
4. After the CM7 application build click on Download/F8 button (menu Flash -> Download).
5. Power off and power on the board.
6. Multicore example starts running, one can start debugging the CM7 side by clicking on Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5). 
7. It is not possible to attach to the CM4 core when using the J-Link.
