Overview
========
The Multicore eRPC Matrix Multiply RTOS project is a simple demonstration program that uses the
MCUXpresso SDK software and the Multicore SDK to show how to implement the Remote Procedure Call
between cores of the multicore system. The primary core (eRPC client) releases the secondary core
(eRPC server) from the reset and then the erpcMatrixMultiply() eRPC call is issued to let the
secondary core to perform the multiplication of two randomly generated matrices. The original
matrices and the result matrix is printed out to the serial console by the primary core. The
matrix multiplication can be issued repeatedly when pressing a SW board button. RPMsg-Lite erpc
transport layer is used in this example application.

Shared memory usage
This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared memory region is
defined and the size can be adjustable in the linker file. The shared memory region start address
and the size have to be defined in linker file for each core equally. The shared memory start
address is then exported from the linker to the application.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.


Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the eRPC Matrix Multiply RTOS demo in the terminal window:

Note:
The "Copy CORE1 image to address..." log message is not displayed on the terminal window when MCUXpresso IDE is used.
In case of MCUXpresso IDE the secondary core image is copied to the target memory during startup automatically.

Note:
To download and debug IAR EW project using J-Link (replacing the default CMSIS-DAP debug probe), following steps are needed:
1. Remove J6 and J7 jumpers.
2. Attach the J-Link probe (J-Link Plus / J-Trace) to the board using the J1 connector.
3. Set "J-Link / J-Trace" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Setup panel (replacing CMSIS-DAP option).
4. Unselect the "Use macro file(s)" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Setup panel.
5. Enable "Use command line options" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Extra Options panel 
   (--jlink_script_file=$PROJ_DIR$/../evkbmimxrt1170_connect_cm4_cm7side.jlinkscript command line option is applied).
5. Click on "Download and Debug" button. During the loading process you can be asked by J-Link sw
   to select the proper device name (MIMXRT1176XXXA_M7 is unknown). Click O.K. and choose the MIMXRT1176xxxxA device.
6. It is not possible to attach to the CM4 core when using the J-Link. Also, the multicore debugging does not work with that probe.

Note:
To download and debug Keil MDK project using J-Link (replacing the default CMSIS-DAP debug probe), following steps are needed:
1. Remove J6 and J7 jumpers.
2. Attach the J-Link probe (J-Link Plus / J-Trace) to the board using the J1 connector.
3. Set "J-LINK / J-TRACE Cortex" in CM7 project options -> Debug panel (replacing CMSIS-DAP Debugger option).
4. After the CM7 application build click on Download/F8 button (menu Flash -> Download).
5. Power off and power on the board.
6. Multicore example starts running, one can start debugging the CM7 side by clicking on Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5). 
7. It is not possible to attach to the CM4 core when using the J-Link.
