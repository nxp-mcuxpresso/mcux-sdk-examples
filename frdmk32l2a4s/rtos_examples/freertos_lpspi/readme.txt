Overview
========
The lpspi_interrupt example shows how to use LPSPI driver in interrupt way:

In this example , one lpspi instance used as LPSPI master and another lpspi instance used as LPSPI slave.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)

The example supports board to board connection.

With board to board connection, one LPSPI instance on one board is used as LPSPI master and the LPSPI instance on other board is used as LPSPI slave. Tasks are created to run on each board to handle LPSPI communication.
    File freertos_lpspi.c should have following definitions:
    #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_SPI BOARD_TO_BOARD
    For board used as LPSPI master:
        #define SPI_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER
    For board used as LPSPI slave:
        #define SPI_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.5.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K32L2A4S board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To make the example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to      SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
SOUT       J2 pin 8             SIN       J20 pin 7
SIN        J2 pin 10            SOUT      J20 pin 6
SCK        J2 pin 12            SCK       J20 pin 5
PCS0       J2 pin 6             PCS0      J20 pin 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FreeRTOS LPSPI example start.
This example use one lpspi instance as master and another as slave on a single board.
Master and slave are both use interrupt way.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave
    CLK      --    CLK
    PCS      --    PCS
    SOUT     --    SIN
    SIN      --    SOUT

LPSPI master transfer completed successfully.
LPSPI slave transfer completed successfully.
LPSPI transfer all data matched !
