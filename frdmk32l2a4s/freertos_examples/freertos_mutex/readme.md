Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_mutex example. It shows how mutex manage access to common
resource (terminal output).

The example application creates two identical instances of write_task. Each task will lock the mutex
before printing and unlock it after printing to ensure that the outputs from tasks are not mixed
together.

The test_task accept output message during creation as function parameter. Output message have two
parts. If xMutex is unlocked, the write_task_1 acquire xMutex and print first part of message. Then
rescheduling is performed. In this moment scheduler check if some other task could run, but second
task write_task+_2 is blocked because xMutex is already locked by first write task. The first
write_task_1 continue from last point by printing of second message part. Finaly the xMutex is
unlocked and second instance of write_task_2 is executed.

==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"ABCD | EFGH"
"1234 | 5678"
"ABCD | EFGH"
"1234 | 5678"
