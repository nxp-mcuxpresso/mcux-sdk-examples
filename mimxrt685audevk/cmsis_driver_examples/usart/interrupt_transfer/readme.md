Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage method please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The cmsis_uart_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use uart cmsis driver in interrupt way:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Note: The example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
USART CMSIS interrupt example
Board receives 8 characters then sends them out
Now please input:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you input 8 characters, system will echo it by USART and them would be seen on the terminal.
