Overview
========

This document explains the freertos_queue example. This example introduce simple logging mechanism
based on message passing.

Example could be devided in two parts. First part is logger. It contain three tasks:
log_add().....Add new message into the log. Call xQueueSend function to pass new message into
              message queue.
log_init()....Initialize logger (create logging task and message queue log_queue).
log_task()....Task responsible for printing of log output.

Second part is application of this simple logging mechanism. Each of two tasks write_task_1 and
write_task_2 print 5 messages into log.



SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8MN6-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.



Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW101 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J901 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will show debug console output.

Example output:
Log 0: Task1 Message 0
Log 1: Task2 Message 0
Log 2: Task1 Message 1
Log 3: Task2 Message 1
Log 4: Task1 Message 2
Log 5: Task2 Message 2
Log 6: Task1 Message 3
Log 7: Task2 Message 3
Log 8: Task1 Message 4
Log 9: Task2 Message 4
