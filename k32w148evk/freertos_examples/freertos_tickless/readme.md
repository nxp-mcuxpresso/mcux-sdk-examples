it is woken up either by expired time delay using low power timer module or by external interrupt caused by a
user defined button.

- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- K32W148-EVK Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the EVK board J14.
