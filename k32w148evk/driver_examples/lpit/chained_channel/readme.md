Overview
========
The LPIT chained_channel project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT driver. It sets up the LPIT 
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second in the channel No.0, the channel 
No.1 chained with channel No.0, if LPIT contain more than two channels, the channel No.2 chained with 
channel No.1....the channel No.N chained with Channel No.N-1. 
Chaining the timer channel causes them to work in a 'nested loop' manner thereby leading to an effective
timeout value up to TVALn Ã— ((TVALn-1) + 1) at channel No.N. The timer counts down for 5 (TVALn + 1) timer
cycles until the timer reaches 0, then the timer generates an interrupt and loads the Timer Value register
(TVALn) value again. The example sets the timer period of the channel to 5 by using the API LPIT_SetTimerPeriod().
When the LPIT interrupt is triggered a message a printed on the serial terminal.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- K32W148-EVK Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you will see the similar information from the terminal shown as below.
Detail prints for each channel depends on by the total numbs of chained channels and the order of 
interrupt flag handler process for each channel.
