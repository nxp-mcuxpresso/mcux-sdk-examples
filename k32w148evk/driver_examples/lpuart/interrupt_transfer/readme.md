Overview
========
The lpuart_interrupt Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 in a group of 8 characters.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- K32W148-EVK Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the EVK board J14.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lpuart interrupt example
Board receives 8 characters then sends them out
Now please input:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you input 8 characters, system will echo it by LPUART and them would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal.
