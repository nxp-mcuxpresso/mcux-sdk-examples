Overview
========
The lpuart_functioncal_interrupt example shows how to use lpuart driver functional
API to receive data with interrupt method:

In this example, one lpuart instance connect to PC, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- K32W148-EVK Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the EVK board J14.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
