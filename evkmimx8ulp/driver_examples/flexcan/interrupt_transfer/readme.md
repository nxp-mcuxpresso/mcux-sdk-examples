Overview
========
The flexcan_interrupt example shows how to use FlexCAN driver in none-blocking interrupt way:

In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to
Endpoint B(board B) when user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receive the message, print
the message content to terminal and echo back the message. Endpoint A will increase the received
message and waiting for the next transmission of the user initiated.

For self wake up from STOP mode, since steps which MCU enters STOP mode differs on different MCUs,
take flexcan_interrupt_transfer of twrke18f for example, user should do like this:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#include "fsl_smc.h"
...
...
flexcanConfig.enableSelfWakeup = true;
FLEXCAN_Init();
...
...
SMC_SetPowerModeStop(SMC, kSMC_PartialStop1);
if (wakenUp)
{
    PRINTF("B has been waken up!\r\n\r\n");
}
...
...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- two MIMX8ULP-EVK/EVK9 board
- JLink Plus
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
populate J8 for two boards.
The example requires connecting between CAN pins of two boards.
The connection should be set as follows:

Between two boards:
- J8-1(CANH) node A, J8-1(CANH) node B
- J8-2(CANL) node A, J8-2(CANL) node B
- J8-3(GND) node A, J8-3(GND) node B


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and JLink Plus to the board, switch SW10 to power on the board
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J17 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This message displays on the node A terminal:

********* FLEXCAN Interrupt EXAMPLE *********

    Message format: Standard (11 bit id)

    Message buffer 9 used for Rx.

    Message buffer 8 used for Tx.

    Interrupt Mode: Enabled

    Operation Mode: TX and RX --> Normal

*********************************************

Please select local node as A or B:

Note: Node B should start first.

Node:a

Press any key to trigger one-shot transmission

Rx MB ID: 0x123, Rx MB data: 0x0, Time stamp: 8877

Press any key to trigger the next transmission!

Rx MB ID: 0x123, Rx MB data: 0x1, Time stamp: 32459

Press any key to trigger the next transmission!

This message displays on the node B terminal:

********* FLEXCAN Interrupt EXAMPLE *********

    Message format: Standard (11 bit id)

    Message buffer 9 used for Rx.

    Message buffer 8 used for Tx.

    Interrupt Mode: Enabled

    Operation Mode: TX and RX --> Normal

*********************************************

Please select local node as A or B:

Note: Node B should start first.

Node:b

Start to Wait data from Node A

Rx MB ID: 0x321, Rx MB data: 0x0, Time stamp: 5759

Wait Node A to trigger the next transmission!

Rx MB ID: 0x321, Rx MB data: 0x1, Time stamp: 57276

Wait Node A to trigger the next transmission!
