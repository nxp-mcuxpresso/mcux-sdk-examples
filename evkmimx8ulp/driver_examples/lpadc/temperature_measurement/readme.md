Overview
========

The lpadc_temperature_measurement example shows how to measure the temperature within the internal sensor.

In this example, the ADC input channel is mapped to an internal temperature sensor. When running the project, typing
any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC watermark interrupt would be asserted once the number of
datawords stored in the ADC Result FIFO is greater than watermark value. In ADC ISR, the watermark flag would be
cleared by reading the conversion result value. When the conversion done, two valid result will be put in the FIFO,
then the temperature can be calculated within the two results and a specific formula. 

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8ULP-EVK/EVK9 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:
