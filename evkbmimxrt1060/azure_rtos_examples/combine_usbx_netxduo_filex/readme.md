Overview
========
This is a small ping demo of the high-performance NetX Duo TCP/IP stack.
And the device registers the number of ping received and write it into
PING.txt which is stored on a RAM disk and can be read  as a USB Mass
Storage Device.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- EVKB-MIMXRT1060 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert Cable to Ethernet RJ45 port and connect it to a ethernet switch.
4.  Write the program to the flash of the target board.
5.  Press the reset button on your board to start the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo is running, the serial port will output:

Start the ping example...
MAC address: 00:11:22:33:44:56
DHCP In Progress...
IP address: 192.168.2.10
Mask: 255.255.255.0

It shows that the board gets a new IP address, for example, 192.168.2.10. Then, on a PC,
use the ping command to ping the new IP address of the board, for example:

$ ping 192.168.2.10
Pinging 192.168.2.10 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=5ms TTL=127
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=127
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=3ms TTL=127
Reply from 192.168.2.10: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=127

It shows that the example program running on the board can handle ping packages.

Connect a USB cable between the PC and the USB device port (USB OTG,J9) of the board.
You will observe a disk being enumerated.

Go to the enumerated disk and check the content of the PING.txt file, it will have ping
received count “Ping count is 4”.

Note: USB storage is not designed for a way to manage storage that can be easily sync with
file system, since USB storage access disk sector by sector instead of by files. Thus, any
updates on file will not be visible until the USB cable is removed and then connected back
again. So, if any ping is received while the USB cable was connected will not be visible to
users until user unplug and re-plug the USB cable between the PC and the USB device port.
