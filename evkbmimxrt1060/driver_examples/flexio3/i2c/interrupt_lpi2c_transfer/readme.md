Overview
========
The flexio_lpi2c_interrupt example shows how to use flexio i2c master  driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated i2c master connect to a LPI2C slave

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1060-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To make this example work, connections needed to be as follows:

    FLEXIO_I2C        connected to  LPI2C1
SCL     J33-5           -->        J16-1
SDA     J33-6           -->        J16-2

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
You can see the similar message shows following in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

Note
This case use flexio3 to simulate i2c protocol. 

Owing to this simulate process is software and executed in qspi_flash for flexspi_nor target. 

But external flash's speed can not support to the rate of I2C transmit because of effected by performance. 

So the settings for baudrate of transmission do not more than 150k in this case.

Note
- The target of SDRAM debug on Keil(5.24) and ARMGCC(2017 q2) can not run successfully.
