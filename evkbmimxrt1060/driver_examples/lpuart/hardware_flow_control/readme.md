Overview
========
The lpuart_hardware_flow_control Example project is to demonstrate usage of the hardware flow control function.
This example will send data to itself(loopback), and hardware flow control will be enabled in the example.
The CTS(clear-to-send) pin is for transmiter to check if receiver is ready, if the CTS pin is assert, transmiter start
to send data. The RTS(request-to-send) is a pin for receiver to inform the transmiter if receiver is ready to receive
data. So, please connect RTS to CTS pin directly.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1060-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
UART hardware flow control on one board.
The UART will send data to itself(loopback), and hardware flow control function will be 
enabled on this example. So, please make sure the correct connection for example.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pin Name    Board Location    connect to     Pin Name    Board Location
LPUART_TX   J16   Pin 2       ----------     LPUART_RX   J16   pin 1
LPUART_CTS  J33   Pin 3       ----------     LPUART_RTS  J33   Pin 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is LPUART hardware flow control example on one board.
This example will send data to itself and will use hardware flow control to avoid the overflow.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
      LPUART_TX    --     LPUART_RX
      LPUART_RTS   --     LPUART_CTS
Data matched! Transfer successfully.
