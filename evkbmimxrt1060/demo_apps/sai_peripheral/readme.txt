Overview
========
The SAI Demo application demonstrates complicated digital audio playback and record case. The demo provide these features below:
1. Duplex audio transfer, record and playback at same time.
2. Playback a 250 Hz sine wave data generated by CMSIS-DSP library. Also compute the fundamental frequency using Fast Fourier Transform with CMSIS-DSP library.
3. Record a 5 seconds audio to sdcard with a FatFs system. After record, playback it. This feature may only existed in platform which support sdhc.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1060-EVKB board
- Personal Computer
- Headphone(OMTP standard)
- SD card

Board settings
==============
Make sure resistors R368/R347/R349/R365/R363 are removed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.	Insert SD card to card slot
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Insert the headphones into the headphone jack on MIMXRT1060-EVKB board (J34).
6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
Note: This demo uses both headphone mic and board main mic(P1) as input source. The headphone mic provides left
channel data, and main mic (P1) provides right channel data. If users found there is noise while do record operation,
most probably it is the headphone standard issue (OMTP and CTIA standard difference). should use the OMTP
standard headphone. You can disable the left channel by using an headphone without microphone feature.

Before you run this demo, please check the txHandle and rxHandle variable in peripherals.c, make sure they are in non-cache area.

This following section shows how to run the demo:

Please note that the log print out may be different according to the different card,
If the card doesn't been formatted ,the case will making new file system and below log will be printed,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAI Peripheral Demo started!
Please insert a card into board.

Card inserted.

Make file system......The time may be long if the card capacity is big.

Create directory......
Please choose the option :
1. Record and playback at same time
2. Playback sine wave
3. Record to SDcard, after record playback it
4. Quit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the card is formatted already, the case will mount the file system only, the case will print below log,
