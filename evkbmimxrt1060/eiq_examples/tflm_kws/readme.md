Overview
========
Keyword spotting example based on Keyword spotting for Microcontrollers [1].

Input data preprocessing

Raw audio data is pre-processed first - a spectrogram is calculated: A 40 ms
window slides over a one-second audio sample with a 20 ms stride. For each
window, audio frequency strengths are computed using FFT and turned into
a set of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Only first 10 coefficients
are taken into account. The window slides over a sample 49 times, hence
a matrix with 49 rows and 10 columns is created. The matrix is called a spectrogram.

In the example, static audio samples ("off", "right") are evaluated first
regardless microphone is connected or not. Secondly, audio is processed directly
from microphone.

Classification

The spectrogram is fed into a neural network. The neural network is a depthwise
separable convolutional neural network based on MobileNet described in [2].
The model produces a probability vector for the following classes:
"Silence", "Unknown", "yes", "no", "up", "down", "left", "right", "on", "off",
"stop" and "go".

Quantization

The NN model is quantized to run faster on MCUs and it takes in a quantized
input and produces a quantized output. An input spectrogram needs to be scaled
from range [-247, 30] to range [0, 255] and round to integers. Values lower
than zero are set to zero and values exceeding 255 are set to 255. An output
of the softmax function is a vector with components in the interval (0, 255)
and the components will add up to 255).   

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:
Say different keyword so that microphone can catch them. Voice recorded from
the microphone can be heared using headphones connected to the audio jack.
Note semihosting implementation causes slower or discontinuous audio experience. 
Select UART in 'Project Options' during project import for using external debug
console via UART (virtual COM port).
