Overview
========
Convolutional neural network (CNN) example with the use of
convolution, ReLU activation, pooling and fully-connected functions.

The CNN model in the example was trained using the scripts available at [1]
with the CifarNet model. 
The configuration of the model was modified to match the neural 
network structure in the CMSIS-NN CIFAR-10 example.
The example source code is a modified version of the Label Image
example from the TensorFlow Lite examples [2], adjusted to run on MCUs.
The neural network consists of 3 convolution layers interspersed by
ReLU activation and max pooling layers, followed by a fully-connected layer
at the end. The input to the network is a 32x32 pixel color image, which is 
classified into one of the 10 output classes. The model size is 91 KB.

Firstly a static ship image is used as input regardless camera is connected or not.
Secondly runtime image processing from camera in the case camera and display
is connected. Camera data are displayed on LCD. 

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:
To classify an image, place an image in front of the camera so that it fits in the
white rectangle in the middle of the LCD display. 
Note that semihosting implementation causes slower or discontinuous video experience. 
Select UART in 'Project Options' during project import for using external debug console 
via UART (virtual COM port).
