Overview
========
The cmsis_lpspi_int_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI CMSIS driver in interrupt way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'cmsis_lpspi_int_b2b_transfer_master.c' includes the LPSPI master code.
This example uses the transactional API in LPSPI driver.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt . 

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1060-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Weld 0Ω resistor to R346,R350,R356,R362.

LPSPI:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to           SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J17-4                SIN       J17-5
SIN        J17-5                SOUT      J17-4
SCK        J17-6                SCK       J17-6
PCS0       J17-3                PCS0      J17-3
GND        J17-7                GND       J17-7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

LPSPI CMSIS driver board to board interrupt example.
This example use one board as master and another as slave.
Master and slave uses interrupt way. Slave should start first. 
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is: 
LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave   
   CLK       --    CLK  
   PCS       --    PCS 
   SOUT      --    SIN  
   SIN       --    SOUT 
   GND       --    GND 

 Master transmit:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F 10
 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20
 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F 30
 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F 40
This is LPSPI_MasterSignalEvent_t
Master transmit data to slave has completed!
This is LPSPI_MasterSignalEvent_t
Master receive data from slave has completed!
 
LPSPI transfer all data matched! 

 Master received:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F 10
 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20
