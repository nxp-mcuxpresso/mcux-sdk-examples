Overview
========
The flexcan_pingpang_buffer_transfer example shows how to use the FlexCAN queue feature to create
2 simulate FIFOs that can receive CAN/CANFD frames:

In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send CAN/CANFD messages to
Endpoint B(board B) when user inputs the number of CAN messages to be sent in terminal. Endpoint B uses
two receiving queues to receive messages in turn, and prints the message content and the receiving queue
number to the terminal after any queue is full.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN236 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires 2 sets of boards, each of them is mounted with the base board.
To make example work, connections needed to be as follows on each base board:

Board to board connections needed to be as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Node A           connect to      Node B
Pin Name   Board Location         Pin Name    Board Location
CANH       J13-2                  CANH        J13-2
CANL       J13-4                  CANL        J13-4
GND        J13-3                  GND         J13-3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for MCU-Link serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the example.

Running the demo
================
After connecting the two boards, these instructions display on each terminal window.
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between the node A and the node B.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This message displays on the node A terminal:

********* FLEXCAN PingPong Buffer Example *********
    Message format: Standard (11 bit id)
    Node B Message buffer 1 to 4 used as Rx queue 1.
    Node B Message buffer 5 to 8 used as Rx queue 2.
    Node A Message buffer 8 used as Tx.
*********************************************

Please select local node as A or B:
Note: Node B should start first.
Node:A
Please input the number of CAN/CANFD messages to be send and end with enter.
100
Transmission done.

Please input the number of CAN/CANFD messages to be send and end with enter.
