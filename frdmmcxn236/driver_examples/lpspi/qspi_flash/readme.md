Overview
========
This example shows how to use LPSPI to control the QSPI flash, such as erasing,
programing, reading.  To simplify the code, this example uses GPIO to control
the PCS, but not use LPSPI to control it.

When the project run finished, you can see the pass or fail information from
the terminal.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN236 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for MCU-Link serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The project status and result are shown in the terminal.
