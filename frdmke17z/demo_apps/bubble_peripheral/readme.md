Overview
========
The bubble application demonstrates basic usage of the on-board accelerometer to implement a
bubble level. A bubble level utilizes two axes to visually show deviation from a level plane
(0 degrees) on a given access. 
You can open the mex file with MCUXpresso Config Tool to do further configuration of pin, clock and peripheral.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KE17Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Make sure the FXOS8700CQ(U12) on the board is installed to run this demo.
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar
information from the terminal as shown below.

Welcome to the BUBBLE example

You will see the change of angle data and LED brightness when change the angles of board

x=  6 y = 22
x=  8 y = 26
x= 10 y = 28
x= 10 y = 28
x= 11 y = 29
x= 11 y = 29
