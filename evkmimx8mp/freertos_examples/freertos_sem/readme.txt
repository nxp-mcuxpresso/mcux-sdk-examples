Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_sem example, what to expect when running it and a brief
introduction to the API. The freertos_sem example code shows how semaphores works. Two different
tasks are synchronized in bilateral rendezvous model.

The example uses four tasks. One producer_task and three consumer_tasks. The producer_task starts by
creating of two semaphores (xSemaphore_producer and xSemaphore_consumer). These semaphores control
access to virtual item. The synchronization is based on bilateral rendezvous pattern. Both of
consumer and producer must be prepared to enable transaction.




Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMX8M Plus board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.



Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J23 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will show debug console output.
