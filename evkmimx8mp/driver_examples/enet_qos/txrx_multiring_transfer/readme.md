Overview
========

The example shows the way to use ENET QOS driver to  
 receive and transmit frames supported multi-ring platforms.
 this example is only supported in multi-ring platform.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET MAC.
2. How to use ENET MAC to transmit frames in avb supported 
multiple-ring platforms.

The example transmits 20 number frames. For simple demo, we create frames with some special definition.
1. Build transmission frames with broadcast mac address.
2. Build frames with unicast mac address
3. Send broadcast frames to ring 0 and unitcase frames to ring 1, then receive them back in associated rings.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMX8M Plus board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Example uses phy looback. No need to connect any network cable on port.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J19 USB Debug Port on the CPU board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

 ENET multi-ring txrx example start.

30 frames will be sent in 3 queues, and frames will be received in 3 queues.
The frame transmitted from the ring 0, 1, 2 is 10, 10, 10!
30 frames transmitted succeed!
The frames successfully received from the ring 0, 1, 2 is 10, 10, 10!
