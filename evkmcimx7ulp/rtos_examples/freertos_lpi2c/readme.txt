Overview
========
The LPI2C Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the Low Power Inter-
Integrated Circuit.
The example uses two instances of LPI2C, one in configured as master and the other one as slave.
The LPI2C master sends data to LPI2C slave. The slave will check the data it receives and shows the log.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires doing connection between two LPI2C pins.
Please use two dupontline to touch the test point (TP) on MCIMX7ULP-EVK base board as following:
- TP24, TP25 connected
- TP26, TP27 connected

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
