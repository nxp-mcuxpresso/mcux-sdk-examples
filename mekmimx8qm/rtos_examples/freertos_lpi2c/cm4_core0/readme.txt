Overview
========
The LPI2C Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the Low Power Inter-
Integrated Circuit.
The example uses two instances of LPI2C, one in configured as master and the other one as slave.
The LPI2C master sends data to LPI2C slave. The slave will check the data it receives and shows the log.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK Board
- MCIMX8-8X-BB
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
LPI2C single board example:
  + LPI2C pins of MASTER are connected with LPI2C pins of SLAVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER        CONNECTS TO                       SLAVE
Pin Name  Base Board Location  Pin Name  Base Board Location
LPI2C_SCL   J30-5              LPI2C_SCL     J7-1 
LPI2C_SDA   J30-6              LPI2C_SDA     J7-3 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.
