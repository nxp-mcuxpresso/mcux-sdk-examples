Overview
========

This document explains the freertos_queue example. This example introduce simple logging mechanism
based on message passing.

Example could be devided in two parts. First part is logger. It contain three tasks:
log_add().....Add new message into the log. Call xQueueSend function to pass new message into
              message queue.
log_init()....Initialize logger (create logging task and message queue log_queue).
log_task()....Task responsible for printing of log output.

Second part is application of this simple logging mechanism. Each of two tasks write_task_1 and
write_task_2 print 5 messages into log.



Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK CPU Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Log 0: Task1 Message 0
Log 1: Task2 Message 0
Log 2: Task1 Message 1
Log 3: Task2 Message 1
Log 4: Task1 Message 2
Log 5: Task2 Message 2
Log 6: Task1 Message 3
Log 7: Task2 Message 3
Log 8: Task1 Message 4
Log 9: Task2 Message 4
