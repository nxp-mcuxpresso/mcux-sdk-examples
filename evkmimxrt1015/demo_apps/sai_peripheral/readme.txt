Overview
========
The SAI Demo application demonstrates complicated digital audio playback and record case. The demo provide these features below:
1. Duplex audio transfer, record and playback at same time.
2. Playback a 250 Hz sine wave data generated by CMSIS-DSP library. Also compute the fundamental frequency using Fast Fourier Transform with CMSIS-DSP library.
3. Record a 5 seconds audio to sdcard with a FatFs system. After record, playback it. This feature may only existed in platform which support sdhc.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.5.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1015 board
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack on EVK-MIMXRT1015 board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
This following section shows how to run the demo:
Notice, on EVK-MIMXRT1015 board, the audio record source is from two microphones. The left channel is from
the headphone microphone, the right channel from the main microphone on board. It is OK for you to choose one
of them or both.
As the headphone microphone may have headphone standard differernt issue, you can just use main microphone
on board as input source.

Known issue:
If pressing SW9 to rerun the demo frequently, it may cause booting from QSPI nor flash failed, since the SA1 RXD0 pin is muxed as boot configurations pin.
Workaround: To use SW3 instead of SW9.

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
