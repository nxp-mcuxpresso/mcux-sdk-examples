When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC interrupt would be asserted once the conversion is completed. In ADC ISR, the conversion completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The point is that the adc interrupt configuration is set when configuring the adc's conversion channel. When in software trigger mode, the conversion would be launched by the operation of configuring channel, just like writing aconversion command. So if user wants to generate the interrupt every time the conversion is completed, the channel's configuration with enabling interrupt setting would be used for each conversion." toolchain="armgcc mcuxpresso" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="driver_examples/adc" path="driver_examples/adc/interrupt">

The ENC hardware is created with a special synchronize mechanism. There are actually 4 counters (the 32-bit position counter is combined with the two 16-bit counter registers) for position with responding hold registers.

INDEX: This pulse can optionally reset the position counter and the pulse accumulator of the quadrature decoder module. It also causes a change of state on the revolution counter. The direction of this change, increment or decrement, is calculated from the PHASEA and PHASEB inputs.HOME: This input can be used to trigger the initialization of the position counters. Often this signal is connected to a sensor signalling the motor or machine, sending notification that it has reached a defined home position.TRIGGER: This input can be used to clear the position counters or to take a snapshot of the POS, REV, and POSD registers. Often this signal is connected to a periodic pulse generator or timer to indicate an elapsed time period.This example uses INDEX to response the external event.
