Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_sem example, what to expect when running it and a brief
introduction to the API. The freertos_sem example code shows how semaphores works. Two different
tasks are synchronized in bilateral rendezvous model.

The example uses four tasks. One producer_task and three consumer_tasks. The producer_task starts by
creating of two semaphores (xSemaphore_producer and xSemaphore_consumer). These semaphores control
access to virtual item. The synchronization is based on bilateral rendezvous pattern. Both of
consumer and producer must be prepared to enable transaction.




Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S16 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect a USB2COM between the PC host and the board UART pins
boards           -               USB2COM
J14-Pin26                        Tx
J14-Pin28                        Rx
J14-Pin1                         GND

The jumper setting:
    Default jumpers configuration does not work,  you will need to add JP20 and JP21 (JP22 optional for ADC use)
    
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will show debug console output.
