Overview
========
The Hello World project is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK UART drivere in
combination with FreeRTOS. The purpose of this demo is to show how to use the debug console and to
provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

The example application creates one task called hello_task. This task print "Hello world." message
via debug console utility and suspend itself.




Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S16 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect a USB2COM between the PC host and the board UART pins
boards           -               USB2COM
J14-Pin26                        Tx
J14-Pin28                        Rx
J14-Pin1                         GND

The jumper setting:
    Default jumpers configuration does not work,  you will need to add JP20 and JP21 (JP22 optional for ADC use)
    
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will print "Hello world" message on terminal.

Example output:
Hello world.
