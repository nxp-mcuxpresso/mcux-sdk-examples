Overview
========
The SCTimer 16-bit counter project is a demonstration program of the SDK SCTimer driver operation when using the SCTimer counter
as two 16-bit counters.
The example toggles an output per counter when a match occurs.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.4.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPC845 Breakout board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the demo
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 9600 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer 16-bit counter demo in the terminal window:
