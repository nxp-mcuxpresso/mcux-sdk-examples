Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_event example. It shows how task waits for an event (defined set
of bits in event group). This event can be set by any other process or interrupt in the system.

The example application creates three tasks. Two write tasks write_task_1 and write_task_2
continuously setting event bit 0 and bit 1.

Read_task is waiting for any event bit and printing actual state on console. Event bits are
automatically cleared after read task is entered.

Three possible states can occurre:
Both bits are set.z
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1010 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
2. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
3. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will start printing the state of event bits.

Example output:
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set
