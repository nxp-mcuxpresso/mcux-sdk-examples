Overview
========
The wifi_httpsrv demo application demonstrates an HTTPServer on the lwIP TCP/IP stack with FreeRTOS.
The user uses an Internet browser to send a request for connection. The board acts as an HTTP server and sends a Web
page back to the PC

Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
For more information about Wi-Fi module connection see:
    readme_modules.txt

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-RW612 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB-C cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J10) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
1.	When the demo runs, it tries to connect to your network and acquire configuration form DHCP.
2.	On success network configuration will be printed.
3.	On the browser address bar, type IP address of the board.
	The browser should show a web page. The board also advertises itself using mDNS so that it can be accessed using URL http://wifi-http.local.
	Please note that your system may not support mDNS out-of-the-box as it is necessary to have an mDNS resolver installed.
    For instance Bonjour Print Services for Windows contain such resolver. In case of Linux nss-mdns serves this purpose.
    Username admin and password admin is required to access "Authorization example" section of the web page.


Modifying content of static web pages
To modify content available through the web server you must complete following steps:
  1. Modify, add or delete files in folder "boards\<board_name>\lwip_examples\lwip_httpsrv_freertos\webpage".
  2. Run the script file "middleware\lwip\src\apps\httpsrv\mkfs\mkfs.pl <directory name>" to generate new "httpsrv_fs_data.c".
     Make sure to execute it from a folder where the file "httpsrv_fs_data.c" is. For example:
        C:\sdk\boards\<board_name>\lwip_examples\lwip_httpsrv_freertos> C:\sdk\middleware\lwip\src\apps\httpsrv\mkfs\mkfs.pl webpage
		Processing file webpage/auth.html
		Processing file webpage/cgi.html
		Processing file webpage/favicon.ico
		Processing file webpage/help.html
		Processing file webpage/httpsrv.css
		Processing file webpage/index.html
		Processing file webpage/NXP_logo.png
		Processing file webpage/poll.html
		Processing file webpage/request.js
		Processing file webpage/ssi.shtml
		Processing file webpage/welcome.html
		Done.
  3. Make sure the "httpsrv_fs_data.c" file has been overwritten with the newly generated content.
  4. Re-compile the HTTP server application example and download it to your board.
