Overview
========
The spi_dma_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use driver API to transfer in DMA way.  

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on the other board as slave. 
Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks
if the data received from master is correct. This example needs to work with spi_dma_b2b_transfer_master 
example.

Note: This example will run in slave mode, please prepare another board for master, and the slave 
      board should be started first.

Project Infomation

Program Flow:
Main routine:
  1.Initialize the hardware.
	Configure pin settings, clock settings by using BOARD_InitHardware();
	
  2.Send information to terminal by using debug console.
	
  3.Initialize the SPI with configuration.
	
  4.Set up DMA configuration for slave SPI.
    Initialize DMA and DMA channel setting(create handle and set callback) for both
    SPI RX and TX, set prioritory for TX channel and RX channel.
	
  5.Start SPI master transfer in DMA way.
    Initialize buffers and start SPI transfer in DMA way.
	
  6.Check if data from master is all right.
    Waiting for transmission complete, print received data and log information to terminal.
  
  7.De-initialize the SPI and DMA.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB-C cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J10) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is SPI DMA tranfer slave example.
This example will communicate with another master SPI on the other board.
Slave board is working...!

The received data are:
