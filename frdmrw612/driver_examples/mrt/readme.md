Overview
========
The MRT project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK MRT driver. It sets up the MRT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 250 milliseconds. When the PIT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the UART terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-RW612 v2 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB-C cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J10) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the MRT driver demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting channel No.0 ...
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occured !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occured !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occured !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Also the blue led is toggling with interrupt triggering.
