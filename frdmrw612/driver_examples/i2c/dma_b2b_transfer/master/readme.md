Overview
========
The i2c_dma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i2c driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with DMA:

In this example, one i2c instance as master and another i2c instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-RW612 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
I2C one board:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of I2C interface, I2C2 pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    I2C2 pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
GPIO_16     J2-18              GPIO_16     J2-18
GPIO_17     J2-20              GPIO_17     J2-20
GND         J2-14              GND         J2-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB-C cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J10) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.
