Overview
========
The CTimer Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK ctimer driver.
In this example, the match feature of the CTimer is used to toggle the output level.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.100

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-RW612 v2 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB-C cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J10) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the CTimer driver simple match demo in the terminal window:
