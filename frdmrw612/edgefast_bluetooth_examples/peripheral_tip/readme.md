Overview
========
Application demonstrating the BLE Peripheral role, except that this application
specifically implements the Time Profile.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C cable
- frdmrw612 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare BLE controller
Download BLE controller FW according to the document component\conn_fwloader\readme.txt.

Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary to the target board, 
please reset the board by pressing SW1 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

4.  Download the program to the target board.

5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE
    to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The demo does not require user interaction.
The application will automatically start advertising the Current Time Service and the 
Reference Time Update Service and it will accept the first connection request it receives.
Once the client configures the Current Time Characteristic CCCD for notifications,
the server will periodically notify its local time value to the client.
