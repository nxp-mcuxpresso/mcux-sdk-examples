Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_sem example, what to expect when running it and a brief
introduction to the API. The freertos_sem example code shows how semaphores works. Two different
tasks are synchronized in bilateral rendezvous model.

The example uses four tasks. One producer_task and three consumer_tasks. The producer_task starts by
creating of two semaphores (xSemaphore_producer and xSemaphore_consumer). These semaphores control
access to virtual item. The synchronization is based on bilateral rendezvous pattern. Both of
consumer and producer must be prepared to enable transaction.

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.
Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will show debug console output.
